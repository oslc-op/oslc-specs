	<section id='abstract'>This document will address backwards compatibility, integration

	capabilities defined in OSLC Core 3.0.</section>

		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>The evolution of OSLC started from some simple documents that defined some XML and JSON formats and some
		interactions based on RESTful HTTP web services.  These were labeled "OSLC 1.0".  As a number of "1.0" specifications
		emerged, common patterns and reuse opportunities emerged.  This then led to the creation of OSLC Core 2.0 [[OSLCCore2]].
		From this, domain specifications were developed as well as specifications for additional common services.  The OSLC Core 2.0 evolution from
		1.0 strengthened its definition of the use of RESTful HTTP web services and adopted an existing standard-based
		approach to representing a data model that was flexible and had multiple representation formats, namely RDF [[rdf11-concepts]].</p>
		<p>With OSLC Core 3.0 specifications based on [[LINKED-DATA]] and namely the Linked Data Platform [[LDP]], OSLC 2.0 and 3.0 are built on the same foundation: Linked Data (HTTP and RDF). This should result in a less-disruptive change from 2.0 to 3.0.
		However, some of the underlying concepts and vocabularies have changed in some areas, and OSLC 2.0 includes capabilities that are not (yet) included in 3.0.</p>
		<p>This document will address
		how best to co-exist with 2.0 existing implementations. It covers the OSLC 2.0 and 3.0 capabilities and discusses approaches for how clients and servers built on different OSLC version can interoperate.</p>
		<p>The goals are not to define how to future proof tools or define a comprehensive versioning model.  Though the
		approach follows established best practices based on Web Architecture [[webarch]] and evolving RDF data models [[rdf11-concepts]].</p>
	</section>

	<section id="terms">
		<h1>Terminology</h1>
		<p>Terminology is based on OSLC Core Overview [[OSLCCore3]], W3C Linked Data Platform [[LDP]], W3C's
			Architecture of the World Wide Web [[webarch]],  Hyper-text Transfer Protocol [[HTTP11]].</p>
		<p>No additional terminology defined.</p>
	</section>

	<section class='informative'>
		<h2>Motivation</h2>
		<p>Adoption of the 3.0 specification and the deployment of those clients and servers will require some period of time. During that time there is a potentially large number of existing OSLC 2.0 clients and servers. The owners of these clients and servers will update their implementations to OSLC 3.0 based on business need and risk managment, and it is expected that these updates will occur at unpredictable and uncoordinated times. Since OSLC is intended to provide a foundation for (lifecycle) application interoperability, it is important to address interoperability between OSLC versions in order to preserve and promote community investments in integrations, and enable upgrade flexibility.</p>

	<section id="diff-from-2" class="informative">
<h2>Changes from OSLC Core 2.0</h2>
<p>The table below summarizes the capabilities from OSLC Core 2.0 based specifications and
what changes have occurred within OSLC Core 3.0. <strong>It is not a complete list of all differences.</strong>
As additional OSLC Core specifications are published, this table may be out of date and require additional changes.  The
individual specifications and associated TCs will produce any needed backwards/forwards or cross dependency collateral.</p>

<p>Some capabilities are in both OSLC 2.0 and OSLC 3.0, but their
    implementation has changed. For example, Discovery [[OSLCDiscovery3]] and Resource Preview
    [[OSLCPreview3]] capabilities are in both versions, but have different implementations.</p>

<p>Many capabilities are no longer specified in OSLC 3.0 because they are part of the W3C Linked Data
    Platform 1.0 [[LDP]].</p>

<p>Other capabilities are not yet specified in OSLC Core 3.0 because they are not currently required by other OASIS domain TCs, do not have sufficient implementations or practice necessary for standardization, or do not yet have TCs to address them. OSLC 2.0 capabilities that are not currently addressed in OSLC Core 3.0 include Resource Shapes, Query (including resource selection and property filtering), Paging, Tracked Resource Set, Actions, and Automation.</p>

<p>Note that the required resource representations have changed. In 2.0, these were often specialized
at a domain level, such as RDF/XML and OSLC JSON representations may been required. Turtle [[turtle]] and JSON-LD
    [[JSON-LD]] are required instead, this is a [[LDP]] requirement.</p>

<p>Servers can continue to support both 2.0 and 3.0 capabilities for backwards compatibility with 2.0 clients.</p>

<section><h2>Making client that works with either 2.0 or 3.0 servers</h2>

	<section><h2>Server/endpoint discovery</h2>
		<p>In order for a client to work with as many possible combinations of servers, it will need be written to be
		flexible and tolerant of changes.  It should be expected that if a server returns URLs from 3.0 discovery mechanisms, that the
		client shouldn't expect to see that server switch back to 2.0 mechanisms.</p>

		<p>3.0 clients should not send the <code>OSLC-Core-Version</code> header, if they do, use the value of "3.0".</p>

		<p>When clients are expecting a URL that is an OSLC 2.0 Service Provider document, they will clearly find a resource of type
		<code>oslc:ServiceProvider</code> and in-lined resources of type <code>oslc:Service</code>.</p>
		<p>When clients are expecting a URL that is an OSLC 3.0 server, they will clearly find a resource of type or subtype of <code>ldp:Container</code>.</p>
	</section>

	<section><h2>Creation of resources of a certain type</h2>
		<p>Based on the approach illustrated in the previous section to determine which version of server you are connected to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>In 2.0, the client will look into an oslc:Server resource, then domain type, then creation factory and finally the type associated with it.</li>
			<li>In 3.0, the client will <a href="https://tools.oasis-open.org/version-control/svn/oslc-core/trunk/specs/discovery.html#creation">inspect the response headers</a>.</li>
		</ul>
	</section>

</section>

<section><h2>Making server that works with either 2.0 or 3.0 clients</h2>

	<section><h2>Server/endpoint discovery</h2>
		<p>OSLC 2.0 clients should provide a HTTP request header of <code>OSLC-Core-Version: 2.0</code> which servers can respond with a 2.0 only response.</p>
		<p>If the <code>OSLC-Core-Version</code> header is not provided on HTTP requests or the value is "3.0", servers can assume the client is at least a 3.0 client and
		prefer 3.0-only responses.</p>

		<p>Optionally, a server can detect when a client uses a URL to make a request for a different version of a resource than the server is expecting.  The
		server can redirect the client to the appropriate URL, using the appropriate HTTP 3xx range redirect codes such as 301 (Moved permanently).</p>

		<p>Additionally, servers could decide to expose additional HTTP response headers, RDF triples and HTTP OPTIONS responses to provide a
		single view of a given resource URL that may have been reserved for a given 2.0 or 3.0 concept.  There may be advantages to reusing URLs say
		for 2.0 creation factories and 3.0 LDP Containers, though in some cases there may be some drawbacks.</p>

		<div class='note'>Do we need to articulate every resource type?</div>
	</section>

</section>

<section><h2>Gracefully upgrading server from 2.0 to 3.0</h2>
	<p>This only applies to client's that support 3.0.  As in the case if the client only supported 2.0, it would only request that and use that.
	Client applications has stored these references:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Service Provider Catalog</li>
		<li>Service Provider</li>
		<li>Linked to Resource</li>
	</ul>
	<p>2.0 client applications shouldn't store other URLs or data, other than for caching purposes.</p>

    <section><h2>Find v2 oslc:ServiceProvider document</h2>
	    <p>In OSLC Core 2.0 based specifications, OSLC Servers (Providers) would be required to expose a resource which has an <code>rdf:type</code>

    </section>

</section>

<section>
	<h2>OSLC-Core-Version</h2>
	<p>Deprecated.  Technically, there is no reason to carry it forward in 3.0.  Each capability should be able to independently describe
	how to discover it using methods established by LDP such as HTTP response headers (Link relations, Accept-Post, ...) [[OSLCDiscovery3]].</p>
	<p>Implementations that have previously tested for the value of this parameter, should ensure their logic properly accounts for
	values that may not be "2.0".  As some may provide the value of "3.0", which shouldn't be seen as an error but instead as just
	an informative header.</p>

	<h2>Resource Preview</h2>
<p>There are key differences between resource preview in OSLC 2.0
    [[OSLCUIPreview20]] and OSLC 3.0 [[OSLCPreview3]]. How Consumers request
    previews and their media types have changed. OSLC 3.0 changes some aspects
    of preview sizing as well.</p>

<section id="discovery">
<h2>Discovery and Resource Representation</h2>
<p>The <code>application/x-oslc-compact+xml</code> media type is no longer
    used. Previews are instead discovered using HTTP <code>Link</code> headers
    or by making GET requests for the target resource with an HTTP
    <code>Prefer</code> header. Additionally, the response is no longer XML.
    Instead Compact resources have JSON or Turtle [[turtle]]
    representations.</p>

<p>Below are OSLC 2.0 and OSLC 3.0 examples for comparison.</p>

<section>
<h2>Discovery in OSLC 2.0</h2>

<p>OSLC 2.0 defined a special media type for its XML Compact representation.
    Even though it appears to be RDF/XML, only a specific XML format is
    allowed.</p>

<p><strong>Request:</strong></p>

<pre class="example">
GET /bugs/12345 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Accept: application/x-oslc-compact+xml
OSLC-Core-Version: 2.0
</pre>

<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>

<pre class="example">
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 527
Content-Type: application/x-oslc-compact+xml
OSLC-Core-Version: 2.0
Vary: Accept

&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns:dcterms="http://purl.org/dc/terms/" xmlns:oslc="http://open-services.net/ns/core#"&gt;
&lt;oslc:Compact rdf:about="http://example.com/bugs/12345"&gt;
&lt;dcterms:title&gt;12345: Need a "fix" &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;NOW&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&lt;/dcterms:title&gt;
&lt;oslc:smallPreview&gt;
    &lt;oslc:Preview&gt;
        &lt;oslc:document rdf:resource="http://example.com/bugs/12345?hover=small"/&gt;
    &lt;/oslc:Preview&gt;
&lt;/oslc:smallPreview&gt;
&lt;/oslc:Compact&gt;
&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;
</pre>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Discovery in OSLC 3.0</h2>

<p>OSLC 3.0 treats Compact as a distinct resource, rather than a
    representation. You can request it in one HTTP request using a
    <code>Prefer</code> header. The response can be JSON or an RDF format like
    Turtle, depending on the <code>Accept</code> header.</p>

<p><strong>Request:</strong></p>

<pre class="example" id="preferExample">
GET /bugs/324 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Accept: application/json
Prefer: return=representation; include="http://open-services.net/ns/core#PreferCompact"
</pre>

<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>

<pre class="example" id="preferenceAppliedExample">
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 315
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8
ETag: "f9d76afe5fbed1655c5768906db8958a"
Preference-Applied: return=representation
Vary: Accept,Accept-Language,Prefer

{
    "compact": {
        "title": "324: Need a fix &lt;em&gt;NOW&lt;/em&gt;",
        "icon": "http://example.com/icons/defect.jpg",
        "largePreview": {
            "document": "http://example.com/bugs/324?preview=large",
            "hintHeight": "250px",
            "hintWidth": "400px"
        }
    }
}
</pre>

<p>Another way to discover the Compact resource is by looking for a
    <code>Link</code> header, which is required in OSLC 3.0.</p>

<strong>Request:</strong>

<pre class="example" id="linkHeaderRequest">
HEAD /bugs/324/screenshot HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
</pre>

<strong>Response:</strong>

<pre class="example" id="linkHeaderResponse">
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 45789
Content-Type: image/png
ETag: "678609cdee68e0fb8aea5f252b84a511"
Link: &lt;http://example.com/bugs/324/screenshot?compact&gt;; rel="http://open-services.net/ns/core#Compact"
</pre>

<p>The consumer then requests the Compact resource directly using its URI.</p>

<strong>Request:</strong>

<pre class="example" id="linkHeaderRequest">
GET /bugs/324/screenshot?compact HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Accept: application/json
</pre>

<strong>Response:</strong>

<pre class="example" id="linkHeaderResponse">

{
    "title": "Screenshot of the problem",
    "shortTitle": "screenshot.png",
    "smallPreview": {

<h2>Preview Sizing</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Resize messages for previews now use <code>oslc-resize</code>
            messages, the same as dialogs, and can set both a height and a
            width. OSLC 2.0 used <code>oslc-preview-height</code>, which was
            inconsistent with dialogs and only allowed changing heights. Note
            that the width and height in an <code>oslc:resize</code> message
            must use [[CSS2]] length units, unlike
            <code>oslc-preview-height</code>, which was always pixels.</li>
        <li><code>oslc:initialHeight</code> and <code>oslc:initialWidth</code>
            are no longer properties on the <code>oslc:Compact</code> resource.
            Instead use <code>oslc:hintHeight</code> and
            <code>oslc:hintWidth</code>. Resize messages can be sent regardless
            of whether size hints were provided.</li>
