<section id="abstract">
    <p>This document discusses best practices and recommendations for implement
        OSLC Resource Preview.</p>
</section>

<section class="informative" id="introduction">

<section id="sotd"></section>

<section id="display">
<h2>Displaying a Preview</h2>
<p>The following guidance is suggested for Client display of a resource link
    and rich previews. For purposes of this discussion, assume source resource
    A has a URI property that refers to target resource B:</p>

<section id="navigating">
<h2>Navigation to the target resource</h2>

<p>At any time, the user <strong>SHOULD</strong> be able to gesture that they
    would like to navigate the link to the target resource, regardless of how
    the link to the target resource happens to be rendered. </p>
</section>

<section id="displayingLinks">
<h2>Default way to display the link to the target resource</h2>

<p>The typical way for forming and displaying the hyperlink
    <strong>SHOULD</strong> be based on information that is stored locally in
    source resource A (or that is generally known to the Client). Generally,
    link text can be derived from property values of resource A, and
    potentially from a string or literal property value in the reference to the
    target resource B, if such a property exists. Because these property values
    are part of the representation of the source resource A, they are available
    without consulting the target resource, and will be available even if the
    target resource B cannot be fetched.  When available, Clients
    <strong>SHOULD</strong> display this string (as opposed to the URI) when
    presenting resource A to indicate a potential navigation to resource B.
    This is the basic presentation of a link to target resource B.</p>

<p>The default display of the link from A to B is visible to any user
    authorized to access resource A. The use of Compact representation
    information described below is only viable for users who are also
    authorized to access resource B.</p>
</section>

<section id="usingTitle">
<h2>Using the Compact representation title, short title, and icon</h2>

<p>A Compact representation of the resource may contain a more accurate and
    slightly richer label for a target resource ( <code>dcterms:title</code>
    element), a short-form title for the resource (
    <code>oslc:shortTitle</code>), and a corresponding image (
    <code>oslc:icon</code>), all of which may be based on the current state of
    the target resource. If this becomes known to the Client, the client
    <strong>SHOULD</strong> assume that this information is better and use it
    in forming the hyperlink that is displayed to the user. When available,
    <code>oslc:shortTitle</code> MAY be used instead of
    <code>dcterms:title</code> in presentations where visual space is severely
    limited.</p>

<p>Clients <strong>SHOULD NOT</strong> fetch Compact representations when
    there is perfectly usable default display information available. When
    designing a Client application, consideration should be given to the
    potential benefits of obtaining an improved title and icon for the target
    resource against the costs of preemptively fetching the Compact
    representation in terms of added load on servers and networks (which might
    only be apparent to users on slow networks or heavily loaded servers).</p>

<p>Clients <strong>SHOULD</strong> be wary of material obtained from
    non-trusted sources; in particular, the Client <strong>SHOULD</strong> check that
    the dcterms:title and oslc:shortTitle property values do not contain HTML
    markup beyond the specified set of simple elements.</p>
</section>

<section id="smallPreview">
<h2>Preview sizing</h2>
<p>When the resource does not supply preferred sizing for a preview, the
    Client <strong>SHOULD</strong> default to a reasonably generous value.
    The default value a Client uses <strong>MAY</strong> be different for
    different window and screen sizes.</p>
</section>

<section id="smallPreview">
<h2>Displaying a small preview</h2>

<p>If a user mouses or hovers over a displayed link, the Client
    <strong>SHOULD</strong> determine whether the target resource has a small
    preview (<code>oslc:smallPreview</code>). If it does, the Client
    <strong>SHOULD</strong> present the small preview document in a hovering
    widget.  Since preview documents may contain arbitrary content, including
    HTML and scripts, Client <strong>MUST</strong> use iframes if embedding
    the preview document inside another HTML-based presentation.</p>

<p>The Client <strong>SHOULD NOT</strong> attempt to prefetch a Compact
    representation just to have the preview URIs in hand so that the hover can
    come up faster. There is a low chance that the user will make a gesture
    that would call for the display of a small preview. It would generally be a
    poor trade-off to increase overall system load just to decrease UI latency
    for low probability eventualities.</p>
</section>

<section id="largePreview">
<h2>Displaying a large preview</h2>

<p>If the user then gestures that they want to see a bit more of the resource,
    the Client should determine whether the target resource has a large
    preview ( <code>oslc:largePreview</code>). If it does, the Client
    <strong>SHOULD</strong> present the large preview document in a stationary
    widget that permits further user interaction. Again, since preview
    documents may contain arbitrary content, including HTML and scripts,
    Clients <strong>MUST</strong> use iframes if embedding the preview
    document inside another HTML-based presentation.</p>
