<section id='abstract'>
<p>This specification defines the OSLC Quality Management domain, a RESTful web
services interface for the management of product, service or software quality artefacts, activities,
tasks and relationships between those and related resources such as requirements, defects, change requests or architectural resources. To support these scenarios, this specification
defines a set of HTTP-based RESTful interfaces in terms of HTTP methods: GET,
POST, PUT and DELETE, HTTP response codes, content type handling and resource
formats.</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>This section is non-normative.</p>
  <p>This specification builds on the OSLC Core Specification to define the resources and operations supported by an Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC) Quality Management (QM) provider.</p>
  <p>Quality Management resources define the test plans, test cases, and test results of the software delivery lifecycle. They represent individual resources along with their relationships to other shared resource types such change requests and requirements. The intent of this specification is to define the set of HTTP-based RESTful interfaces in terms of HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT and DELETE, HTTP response codes, mime type handling and resource formats. The capabilities of the interface definitions are driven by key integration scenarios and therefore don't represent a complete setup of operations on resources or resource types. The resource formats and operations may not match exactly the native models supported by quality management service providers but are intended to be compatible with them. </p>
  <p>A key approach to supporting these scenarios is to delegate operations, as driven by service provider contributed user interfaces, as much as possible and not require a service provider to expose its complete data model and application logic. </p>

<h2>Base Compliance</h2>

<p class=‘conformance’>This specification is based on [[!OSLCCore3]]. OSLC QM servers
MUST be compliant with both the core specification,  MUST follow all the mandatory requirements in the normative sections of this specification, and SHOULD follow all the guidelines and recommendations in both
these specifications.</p>

<p class=‘conformance’>An OSLC QM server MUST implement the domain vocabulary defined in <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/oslc-domains/qm/v2.1/qm-v2.1-part2-quality-management-vocab.html">OSLC Quality Management Version 2.1. Part 2: Vocabulary</a>

<p>The following table summarizes the requirements from OSLC Core Specification
as well as some additional requirements specific to the QM domain. Note that
this specification further restricts some of the requirements for OSLC Core
Specification. See subsequent sections in this specification or the
OSLC Core Specification to get further details on each of these
requirements.</p>

<p>See Query Capabilities for additional information when Resource Shapes affect representation.</p>

<section id="contentNegotiation">
<h2>Content Negotiation</h2>

<p>[[!OSLCCore3]] specifies RDF representations (and specifically Turtle and JSON-LD) as a convention that all OSLC server implementations minimally provide and accept. OSLC QM server implementations are strongly encouraged to adopt this convention. Future versions of this specification are expected to require RDF representations for all operations and relax requirements for specialized XML representations.</p>

<p><strong>XML Representation</strong> - identified by the <code>application/xml</code> content type. Format representation rules are outlined in Core <a href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OSLCCoreSpecAppendixRepresentations">OSLC Core Resource Formats section</a></p>

<p><strong>RDF/XML Representation</strong> - identified by the <code>application/rdf+xml</code> content type. No additional guidance is given.</p>

<p><strong>JSON-LD Representation</strong> - identified by the <code>application/ld+json</code> content type. Format representation rules are specified in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/">JSON-LD 1.0</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Atom Syndication Format XML Representation</strong> - identified by the <code>application/atom+xml</code> content type. Format representation rules are outlined in Core <a href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OSLCCoreSpecAppendixRepresentations">OSLC Core Resource Formats section</a>.</p>

<section id="pagination">
<h2>Pagination</h2>

<p class='conformance'>OSLC QM servers SHOULD support pagination of query results and MAY support pagination of a single resource's properties as defined by [[!OSLCCore3]].</p>
</section>

<section id="requestProps">
<h3>Requesting and Updating Properties</h3>

<section id="requestSubset">
<h4>Requesting a Subset of Properties</h4>

<p class='conformance'>A client MAY request a subset of a resource's properties as well as properties from a referenced resource. In order to support this behavior a server MUST support the <code>oslc.properties</code> and <code>oslc.prefix</code> URL parameter on a HTTP GET request on individual resource request or a collection of resources by query. If the <code>oslc.properties</code> parameter is omitted on the request, then all resource properties MUST be provided in the response.</p>
</section>

<section id="updateSubset">
<h4>Updating a Subset of Properties</h4>

<p class='conformance'>A client MAY request that a subset of a resource's properties be updated by using the [[LDPPatch]] <code>PATCH</code> method.</p>

<p class='conformance'>For compatibility with [[!OSLCCore2]], QM servers MAY also support partial update by identifying those properties to be modified using the <code>oslc.properties</code> URL parameter on a HTTP PUT request.</p>

<p  class='conformance'>If the parameter <code>oslc.properties</code> contains a valid resource property on the request that is not provided in the content, the server MUST set the resource's property to a null or empty value. If the parameter <code>oslc.properties</code> contains an invalid resource property, then a <code>409 Conflict</code> MUST be returned.</p>
</section>

<section id="updatingMultiValueProps">
<h4>Updating Multi-Valued Properties</h4>

<p class='conformance'>For multi-valued properties that contain a large number of values, it may be difficult and inefficient to add or remove property values. OSLC QM servers SHOULD provide support for a partial update of the multi-valued properties as defined by <a href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OslcCorePartialUpdate">OSLC Core Partial Update</a>.</p>
</section>
</section>

<section id="labels" class='informative'>
<h3>Labels for Relationships</h3>

<p>QM resource relationships to other resources are represented by RDF properties. Instances of a relationship - often called links - are RDF triples with a subject URI, a predicate that is the property, and a value (or object) that is the URI of target resource. When a link is to be presented in a user interface, it may be helpful to display an informative and useful textual label instead of or in addition to the URI of the predicate and or object. There are three items that clients could display:
<ul>
  <li><b>The property</b>: OSLC recommends using the rdfs:label property of the rdf:Property from the vocabulary to display the property.</li>
  <li><b>The value, or object of the triple</b>: OSLC recommends using OSLC resource preview [[!OSLCResourcePreview]] to obtain an appropriate icon and label, and possibly a small and/or large dialog for displaying the object.</li>
  <li><b>The link</b>: The link is a combination of the subject, predicate and object of the triple (RDF statement or assertion). In the case where the link requires a unique label that is not available from the target resource, only then OSLC servers may support a dcterms:title on a reified statement to provide a label for a link that describes the assertion itself.</li>
</ul></p> 

<p>Turtle example using a reified statement:</p>

<pre class="example">
@prefix ns0: &lt;http://open-services.net/ns/qm#&gt; .
@prefix rdf: &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&gt; .
@prefix dcterms: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/terms/&gt; .

&lt;http://example.com/tests/4321&gt;
  a &lt;http://open-services.net/ns/qm#TestCase&gt; ;
  ns0:uses &lt;http://anotherexample.com/testscript/123&gt; .

&lt;http://njh.me/#link1&gt;
  a rdf:Statement ;
  rdf:subject &lt;http://example.com//4321&gt; ;
  rdf:predicate ns0:uses ;
  rdf:object &lt;http://anotherexample.com/testscript/123&gt; ;
  dcterms:title &quot;Test Script 123: &quot; .
</pre>

<section id='termsAndConstraints'>
  <h2>Vocabulary Terms and Constraints</h2>
  <p><a href="termsAndConstraints.html">OSLC QM Resources 2.1</a>
    Defines the vocabulary terms and constraints for OSLC Quality Management resources.
    These terms and constraints are specified according to [[!OSLCCoreVocab]].</p>
    <p>The intent is to define resources needed to
    support common integration scenarios and not to provide a comprehensive
    definition of QM resources like Test Case. The resource formats may not match exactly
    the native models supported by quality management service providers, but are
    intended to be compatible with them. The approach to supporting these
    scenarios is to delegate operations, as driven by service provider
    contributed user interfaces, as much as possible and not require a service
    provider to expose its complete data model and application logic.</p>
