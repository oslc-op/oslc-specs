<section id='abstract'>
  <p>This specification defines the OSLC Architecture Management domain, a RESTful web services interface for the management of architectural resources and relationships between those and related resources such as product change requests, activities, tasks, requirements or test cases. To support these scenarios, this specification defines a set of HTTP-based RESTful interfaces in terms of HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT and DELETE, as well as HTTP response codes, content type handling and resource formats.</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>This specification defines a RESTful web services interface for the Architecture Management (AM) domain. This domain addresses the management of product design artifacts including models, and relationships with other resources such as requirements, testing resources and change requests. To support these scenarios, this specification defines a set of HTTP-based RESTful interfaces in terms of HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT and DELETE, HTTP response codes, content type handling and resource formats..</p>

  <p>The intent of this specification is to define the capabilities needed to support integration scenarios defined by the Architecture Management working group and not to provide a comprehensive interface to Architecture Management. The resource formats and operations may not match exactly the native artifacts supported by architecture management AM Servers but are intended to be compatible with them. The approach to supporting these scenarios is to delegate operations, as driven by service provider contributed user interfaces, as much as possible and not require a service provider to expose its complete data model and application logic.</p> 
 
  <p>This specification is a [[!OSLCCore3]] compliant specification, and as such most of its content are references to [[!OSLCCore3]].</p>

  <section id='terminology'>
    <h3>Terminology</h3>
      <dl class="spaced">
      <dt><dfn>Resource</dfn></dt>
      <dd>An artifact used in the Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) space. A resource is directly addressable with an absolute URL.</dd>

      <dt><dfn>Architecture Management Resource (AMR)</dfn></dt>
      <dd>Directly addressable resources of some domain/notation (i.e. UML, 
        BMPN, ER) that represent an abstraction of some behavior or construct of 
        a system under development. An AMR maintains its identity after 
        refactoring. In the semantic web, an AMR might correspond to a graph 
        that is an instance of some vocabulary or micro-theory.</dd> 
        
        <dt><dfn>Link</dfn></dt>
      <dd>A logical relationship from one resource to another resource. An OSLC AM Link is uni-directional. 
        The subject (source) of a link represents the resource that "knows 
        about" and is referencing another resource (target). The type of 
        relationship is given by a predicate URI (link type). In semantic web 
        terminology, a link would correspond to an RDF statement with a subject 
        (source), a predicate (type) and object (target). The predicate could be 
        defined by property in an RDF schema.</dd>


         <dt><dfn>Link type (LT)</dfn></dt>
      <dd>A URI that represents the type of a link. In semantic web terminology it is the predicate of an 
        RDF triple. It clarifies the type of relationship between two resources. 
        Link Type URIs may be defined locally, within the OSLC, or externally 
        (i.e. Dublin Core terms). Link types could be defined in RDF 
        Schemas.</dd>


         <dt><dfn>Link type Resource (LTR)</dfn></dt>
      <dd>A resource that contains human consumable information about a Link Type, like its human readable 
        name and description. The resource is managed by the AM provider. The 
        information may be about a Link Type in a different domain (i.e. Dublin 
        Core Terms or OWL). The main use of an LTR is for clients who want to 
        build a UI for users that clearly labels potential link types.</dd>


    <dt>AM Client</dt>
    <dd>An implementation of the OSLC Architecture Management specifications as a client. OSLC AM Clients consume services provided by AM servers.</dd>

    <dt>AM Server</dt>
    <dd>A server implementing the OSLC Architecture Management domain specifications. OSLC AM clients consume services provided by AM Servers. The use of the terms Client and Server are intended to distinguish typical consumers and providers of OSLC resources in a distributed environment based on REST. A particular application component could be a client for some OSLC domain services and a server for the same or another domain.</dd>

<h2>Base Requirements</h2>

<p>The following sub-sections define the mandatory and optional requirements for an OSLC Architecture Management (OSLC AM) server.</p>

<section id="baseCompliance">
<h2>Base Compliance</h2>
<p class='conformance'>This specification is based on [[!OSLCCore3]]. OSLC AM servers
MUST be compliant with both the core specification,  MUST follow all the mandatory requirements in the normative sections of this specification, and SHOULD follow all the guidelines and recommendations in both
these specifications.</p>

<p>The following table summarizes the requirements from OSLC Core Specification
as well as some additional requirements specific to the AM domain. Note that
this specification further restricts some of the requirements from the OSLC Core
Specification. See the previous sections in this specification or the
OSLC Core Specification to get further details on each of these
requirements.</p>

  resource properties MUST be provided in the response.</p>
</section>

<section id="updateSubset">
<h4>Updating a Subset of Properties</h4>

<p class='conformance'>An OSLC AM client MAY request that a subset of a resource's properties be updated by 
  identifying those properties to be modified using the <code>oslc.properties</code> URL 
  parameter on a HTTP PUT request.</p>

</section>

<section id="updatingMultiValueProps">
<h4>Updating Multi-Valued Properties</h4>

<p class='conformance'>An OSLC AM Server MAY support updating a subset of a resource's properties by using the [[LDPPatch]] <code>PATCH</code> method.</p>

<p class='conformance'>For compatibility with [[!OSLCCore2]], an AM Server MAY also support partial update by identifying those properties to be modified using the <code>oslc.properties</code> URL parameter on a HTTP PUT request.</p>

<p class='conformance'>If the parameter <code>oslc.properties</code> contains a valid resource property on the request that is not provided in the content, the server MUST set the resource's property to a null or empty value. If the parameter <code>oslc.properties</code> contains an invalid resource property, then a <code>409 Conflict</code> MUST be returned.</p>

<section id="ResourceDefs">
<h2>Vocabulary Terms and Constraints</h2>
  <p><a href="architecture-management-vocab.html">OSLC Architecture Management Resources 2.1</a>
    Defines the vocabulary terms and constraints for OSLC Change Management resources.
    These terms and constraints are specified according to [[!OSLCCore3]].</p>

<h2>AM Server Capabilities</h2>

<section id="resourceShapes1">
<h3>Resource Shapes</h3>

  <p class='conformance'>OSLC AM servers SHOULD support Resource Shapes as defined in [[!OSLCShapes]].</p>

</section>

<section id="resources">
<h3>Service Provider Resources</h3>

  <p class='conformance'>OSLC AM Servers MUST provide a ServiceProvider Resource that can be retrieved at a implementation dependent URI.</p>

<p class='conformance'>OSLC AM Servers MUST provide a ServiceProviderCatalog Resource that can be retrieved at a implementation dependent URI.</p>

<p class='conformance'>OSLC AM Servers MUST provide an <code>oslc:serviceProvider</code> property for their defined resources that will be the URI to a ServiceProvider Resource. This does not prevent AM Servers from providing multiple servie provider properties with different values, if the service provider supports multiple OSLC domain specifications, and the resource is applicable to multiple domains.</p>

<p class='conformance'>OSLC AM Servers MUST supply a value of <code>http://open-services.net/ns/am#</code> for the property <code>oslc:domain</code> on either <code>oslc:ServiceProvider</code> or <code>oslc:ServiceProviderCatalog</code> resources.</p>

</section>


<section id="creationfactories">
<h3>Creation Factories</h3>

<p class='conformance'>OSLC AM Servers MAY support CreationFactories as defined by [[!OSLCCore3]].</p>

<p>OSLC AM Servers MAY discard properties it does not recognize and continue the POST operation without warning to the client. The returned resource will contain the accepted properties (and server generated properties like the dcterms:identifer) so clients will be able to confirm if required what was accepted.</p>

<p class='conformance'>If OSLC AM Servers support the creation of resources from the OSLC defined <code>oslc_am:Resource</code> format, there MUST be at least one Creation Factory entry in the Services definition, and its <code>oslc:usage</code> property MUST be set to <code>http://open-services/ns/core#default</code>. The <code>oslc:resourceType</code> MUST be set to <code>http://open-services.net/ns/am#Resource</code>.</p>

<p class='conformance'>If OSLC AM Servers support the creation of resources from a resource other than <code>oslc_am:Resource</code>, there MUST be a separate creation services definition whose <code>oslc:usage</code> property MUST NOT be set to <code>http://open-services/ns/core#default</code>.</p>

</section>

<section id="querycapabilities">
<h3>Query Capabilities</h3>

<p class='conformance'>OSLC AM Servers SHOULD support the Query Capabilities as defined by [[!OSLCCore3]] for both <code>oslc_am:Resource</code> and <code>oslc_am:LinkType</code> resources.</p>

<p class='conformance'>If the service provider supports query capability for <code>oslc_am:Resource</code> resources, it MUST support the following query parameters:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>oslc.where</code></li>
<li><code>oslc.searchTerms</code></li>
</ul>

<p class='conformance'>OSLC AM Servers SHOULD support query capability for <code>oslc_am:LinkType</code> resources. If supported then AM Servers MUST support a simple GET without any query parameters that returns all link type resources. AM Servers SHOULD support the full OSLC query syntax.</p>
</section>

<section id="delegatedUIs">
<h3>Delegated UIs</h3>

<p class='conformance'>OSLC AM Servers SHOULD support the selection of resources by delegated selection dialogs as defined by [[!OSLCCore3]].</p>

<p class='conformance'>OSLC AM Servers MAY support the creation of resources by delegated creation dialogs as defined by [[!OSLCCore3]].</p>

<p class='conformance'>In <code>oslc:Dialog</code> elements, the two optional child elements; <code>oslc:hintWidth</code> and <code>oslc:hintHeight</code> specify the suggested size of the dialog or frame to render the HTML content in. Expected size values are defined by <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS1/#length-units">CSS length units</a>.</p>
