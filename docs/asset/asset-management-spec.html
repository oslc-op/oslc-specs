    <p>This specification defines the OSLC Asset Management domain, a RESTful web services interface for the management of domain
      specifica and supporting resources defined in the OSLC Core specification. To support these scenarios, this specification
      defines a set of HTTP-based RESTful interfaces in terms of HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT and DELETE, HTTP response codes,
      content type handling and resource formats.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>This section is non-normative.</p>
    <p>Asset management systems allow enterprises to catalog, govern, manage, search for, and maintain assets. An asset is anything
      tangible or intangible that provides value through reference or reuse across a wide audience over an extended period
      of time. Assets typically have a lifecycle and require a formal process to govern both modification and access. Cataloging
      assets with standardized taxonomies controls usage and discovery by end users. Assets may also have relationships to
      and dependencies on other assets.</p>

    <p>The term asset in this specification generally refers to either software, documentation, or representations of equipment.
      While other definitions of an asset may be appropriate, financial instruments are not considered an asset in this specification.</p>

    <p>Example software assets may include but are not limited to the final binary output from a software development process,
      libraries such as a Java archive (JAR) or dynamic-link library (DLL), and installable packages that are distributed
      through digital distribution platforms such as a repository or app store. Documentation assets may include presentation
      materials, reports, specifications, blue prints, and instructions. Assets may also represent any type of equipment
      or structure such as computer hardware, automobiles, pumps, buildings, etc.</p>

    <p>Assets are described by a set of properties and zero or more artifacts. An artifact is a file of any type and a set of
      properties that describe the file.</p>

    <p>This specification builds on the Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC) Core v2.0 Specification to define the
      resources, properties and operations supported by an OSLC Asset Management (OSLC-Asset) provider. Asset Management
      resources include Assets, Artifacts and supporting resources defined in the OSLC Core specification. The properties
      defined describe these resources and the relationships between resources. Operations are defined in terms of HTTP methods
      and MIME type handling. The resources, properties and operations defined do not form a comprehensive interface to Asset
      Management, but instead target specific integration use cases documented by the OSLC-Asset workgroup.</p>

    <p>This specification also defines how Assets and Artifacts are represented in OSLC Services. The [[!OSLCAssetResourceDefinition]]
      is a set of properties for an Asset, and includes properties that describe Artifacts of an Asset.</p>

    <section id='terminology' class='informative'>
      <h2>Terminology</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Asset Consumer</strong> - A tool or user that performs asset searching and retrieval activities outlined in the search
        and retrieve scenarios.</p>

      <p>
        <strong>Asset Resource</strong> - An Asset Resource has a set of properties representing an asset. These properties include
        such things as name, description, classification, and the Artifact properties for an Asset.</p>

      <p>
        <strong>Asset Query Resource</strong> - When filtering using simple query, the representation of a list of Asset Resources.</p>

      <p>
        <strong>Asset Submitter</strong> - A tool or user that performs asset preparation activities outlined in the publish scenario.</p>

      <p>
        <strong>Artifact</strong> - This term refers to the properties that describe an Asset Artifact and potentially the Artifact
        Media referenced by this Artifact. An Asset may have zero or more Artifacts.</p>

      <p>
        <strong>Artifact Fragment</strong> - Fragment within an Asset Resource that describes an Artifact Media Resource. The term
        fragment is associated with an Artifact instead of resource because Artifacts are referenced by the Asset&#8217;s
        URL with a fragment identifier. Artifacts are considered to be contained within the asset and when the asset is deleted
        the artifact is also deleted. While two different Artifacts in separate Assets may reference to the same Artifact
        Media Resource, two different Assets may not contain the same Artifact.</p>

      <p>
        <strong>Artifact Media Resource</strong> - The Artifact Media Resource represents the actual artifact content. The content
        can be a presentation, a test case, a binary software component, or any other kind of file.</p>

      <p>
        <strong>Property</strong> - An attribute of a resource. Typically a property is a name/value pair that describes a certain
        aspect of the resource. For example, an asset has many properties such as the asset title, subject/short description,
        version.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Service Provider</strong> - An implementation of the OSLC Asset Management specification as a server. OSLC Asset
        Management clients consume these services.</p>

      <p>
        <strong>Work product</strong> - This term is often used interchangeably with &#8216;artifact&#8217; or &#8216;file&#8217;.
        An asset may have zero or more work products.</p>

    <h2>Base Requirements</h2>
	
	<p>The following sub-sections define the mandatory and optional requirements for an OSLC Asset Management (OSLC Aseet) server.</p>
    
<section id="baseCompliance">
<h2>Base Compliance</h2>

<p class=‘conformance’>This specification is based on [[!OSLCCore3]]. OSLC Asset Management servers
MUST be compliant with both the core specification,  MUST follow all the mandatory requirements in the normative sections of this specification, and SHOULD follow all the guidelines and recommendations in both
these specifications.</p>

<p class=‘conformance’>An OSLC Asset Management server MUST implement the domain vocabulary defined in <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/oslc-domains/qm/v2.1/asset-v2.1-part2-asset-management-vocab.html">OSLC Asset Management Version 2.1. Part 2: Vocabulary</a>

<p>The following table summarizes the requirements from OSLC Core Specification
as well as some additional requirements specific to the Asset domain. Note that
this specification further restricts some of the requirements for OSLC Core
Specification. See subsequent sections in this specification or the
OSLC Core Specification to get further details on each of these
requirements.</p>

      <section id='Content-Negotiation'>
        <h4>Content Negotiation</h4>

        <p>OSLC Core Guidance clearly points to RDF representations (and specifically RDF/XML) as a convention that all OSLC
          Provider implementations minimally provide and accept. OSLC Asset Provider implementations are strongly encouraged
          to adopt this convention. Future versions of this specification are expected to require RDF representations for
          all operations and relax requirements for specialized XML representations.</p>

        <p>
          <strong>XML Representation</strong> - identified by the
          <code>application/xml</code> content type. Format representation rules are outlined in Core
          [[!OSLCCore2RepresentationGuidance]] Formats section
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>RDF/XML Representation</strong> - identified by the
          <code>application/rdf+xml</code> content type. No additional guidance is given. The OSLC Core describes an algorithm for generating consistent
          formats that are used as examples only.</p>

        <p>
          <strong>JSON Representation</strong> - identified by the
          <code>application/json</code> content type. Format representation rules are outlined in Core
          [[!OSLCCore2RepresentationGuidance]] Resource Formats section.</p>

        <p>
          <strong>Atom Syndication Format XML Representation</strong> - identified by the
          <code>application/atom+xml</code> content type. Format representation rules are outlined in Core
          [[!OSLCCore2RepresentationGuidance]] OSLC Core Resource Formats section.</p>

        <p class='conformance'>A client MAY request a subset of a resource&#8217;s properties as well as properties from a referenced resource.
          In order to support this behavior a service provider MUST support the
          <code>oslc.properties</code> and
          <code>oslc.prefix</code> URL parameter on a HTTP GET request on individual resource request or a collection of resources by query. If the
          <code>oslc.properties</code> parameter is omitted on the request, then all resource properties MUST be provided in the response.</p>
      </section>

      <section id='Updating-a-Subset-of-Properties'>
        <h4>Updating a Subset of Properties</h4>

        <p class='conformance'>A client MAY request that a subset of a resource&#8217;s properties be updated by identifying those properties to
          be modified using the
          <code>oslc.properties</code> URL parameter on a HTTP PUT request.</p>

        <p class='conformance'>If the parameter
          <code>oslc.properties</code> contains a valid resource property on the request that is not provided in the content, the server MUST set the
          resource&#8217;s property to a null or empty value. If the parameter
          <code>oslc.properties</code> contains an invalid resource property, then a
          <code>409 Conflict</code> MUST be returned.</p>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section id="labels" class='informative'>
      <h3>Labels for Relationships</h3>

      <p class='conformance'>Asset relationships to other resources are represented as properties whose values are the URI of the object or target
        resource. When an Asset relationship property is to be presented in a user interface, it may be helpful to provide
        an informative and useful textual label for that relationship instance. (This in addition to the relationship property
        URI and the object resource URI, which are also candidates for presentation to a user.) To this end, OSLC providers
        MAY support a
        <code>dcterms:title</code> link property in Asset resource representations, using the anchor approach outlined in the OSLC Core Links Guidance.
        In addition to the textual label, the Asset resource definition defines several properties that can be used to describe
        the relationship from one Asset resource to another Asset resource.</p>

      <p>RDF/XML and XML example using reified statement:</p>

      <pre><code>&lt;rdf:RDF 
       xmlns:dcterms="http://purl.org/dc/terms/" 
       xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"

  &lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;
  </code></pre>

    </section>

    <section id='Custom-Properties'>
      <h3>Custom Properties</h3>

      <p class='conformance'>Asset management providers SHOULD allow consumers to define custom properties. If providers allow consumers to define
        custom properties, they MUST allow the consumer to optionally specify an HTTP URI for that data element, and the
        specified URI MUST be used in the RDF representation of all resources that contain the data element. The specified
        URI MAY be part of an industry standard such as DC, FOAF, or OSLC, or it MAY be defined by the user&#8217;s organization.
        If the URI is defined by the user&#8217;s organization, then they SHOULD make it dereferencable as per the
        [[!W3CBestPractices]].</p>

      <p class='conformance'>If the user does not specify the optional URI, then the provider MUST use a default generated HTTP URI. The generated
        URI SHOULD be as human-readable as possible. One method for achieving human-readability is to apply a human-friendly
        name mangling algorithm to the user-defined label for the data element. The tool SHOULD make the generated URI dereferencable
        as per the
        [[!W3CBestPractices]]. The published RDF vocabulary SHOULD include any relevant
        descriptive information provided the user as part of the data element definition, e.g. the label and description.</p>
