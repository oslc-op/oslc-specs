      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The evolution of OSLC started from some simple documents that defined some XML and JSON formats and some
        interactions based on RESTful HTTP web services. These were labeled "OSLC 1.0". As a number of "1.0"
        specifications emerged, common patterns and reuse opportunities emerged. This then led to the creation of OSLC
        Core 2.0 [[OSLCCore2]]. From this, domain specifications were developed as well as specifications for additional
        common services. The OSLC Core 2.0 evolution from 1.0 strengthened its definition of the use of RESTful HTTP web
        services and adopted an existing standard-based approach to representing a data model that was flexible and had
        multiple representation formats, namely RDF [[rdf11-concepts]].
      </p>
      <p>
        With OSLC Core 3.0 specifications based on [[LINKED-DATA]] and namely the Linked Data Platform [[LDP]], OSLC 2.0
        and 3.0 are built on the same foundation: Linked Data (HTTP and RDF). This should result in a less-disruptive
        change from 2.0 to 3.0. However, some of the underlying concepts and vocabularies have changed in some areas,
        and OSLC 2.0 includes capabilities that are not (yet) included in 3.0.
      </p>
      <p>
        This document will address how best to co-exist with 2.0 existing implementations. It covers the OSLC 2.0 and
        3.0 capabilities and discusses approaches for how clients and servers built on different OSLC version can
        interoperate.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goals are not to define how to future proof tools or define a comprehensive versioning model. Though the
        approach follows established best practices based on Web Architecture [[webarch]] and evolving RDF data models
        [[rdf11-concepts]].
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="terms">
      <h1>Terminology</h1>
      <p>
        Terminology is based on OSLC Core Overview [[OSLCCore3]], W3C Linked Data Platform [[LDP]], W3C's Architecture
        of the World Wide Web [[webarch]], Hyper-text Transfer Protocol [[HTTP11]].
      </p>
      <p>No additional terminology defined.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        Adoption of the 3.0 specification and the deployment of those clients and servers will require some period of
        time. During that time there is a potentially large number of existing OSLC 2.0 clients and servers. The owners
        of these clients and servers will update their implementations to OSLC 3.0 based on business need and risk
        managment, and it is expected that these updates will occur at unpredictable and uncoordinated times. Since OSLC
        is intended to provide a foundation for (lifecycle) application interoperability, it is important to address
        interoperability between OSLC versions in order to preserve and promote community investments in integrations,
        and enable upgrade flexibility.
      </p>

    <section id="diff-from-2" class="informative">
      <h2>Changes from OSLC Core 2.0</h2>
      <p>
        The table below summarizes the capabilities from OSLC Core 2.0 based specifications and what changes have
        occurred within OSLC Core 3.0. <strong>It is not a complete list of all differences.</strong> As additional OSLC
        Core specifications are published, this table may be out of date and require additional changes. The individual
        specifications and associated TCs will produce any needed backwards/forwards or cross dependency collateral.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some capabilities are in both OSLC 2.0 and OSLC 3.0, but their implementation has changed. For example,
        Discovery [[OSLCDiscovery3]] and Resource Preview [[OSLCPreview3]] capabilities are in both versions, but have
        different implementations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many capabilities are no longer specified in OSLC 3.0 because they are part of the W3C Linked Data Platform 1.0
        [[LDP]].
      </p>

      <p>
        Other capabilities are not yet specified in OSLC Core 3.0 because they are not currently required by other OASIS
        domain TCs, do not have sufficient implementations or practice necessary for standardization, or do not yet have
        TCs to address them. OSLC 2.0 capabilities that are not currently addressed in OSLC Core 3.0 include Resource
        Shapes, Query (including resource selection and property filtering), Paging, Tracked Resource Set, Actions, and
        Automation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note that the required resource representations have changed. In 2.0, these were often specialized at a domain
        level, such as RDF/XML and OSLC JSON representations may been required. Turtle [[turtle]] and JSON-LD
        [[JSON-LD]] are required instead, this is a [[LDP]] requirement.
      </p>

      <p>Servers can continue to support both 2.0 and 3.0 capabilities for backwards compatibility with 2.0 clients.</p>

      <h2>Making client that works with either 2.0 or 3.0 servers</h2>

      <section>
        <h2>Server/endpoint discovery</h2>
        <p>
          In order for a client to work with as many possible combinations of servers, it will need be written to be
          flexible and tolerant of changes. It should be expected that if a server returns URLs from 3.0 discovery
          mechanisms, that the client shouldn't expect to see that server switch back to 2.0 mechanisms.
        </p>

        <p>
          3.0 clients should not send the <code>OSLC-Core-Version</code> header, if they do, use the value of "3.0".
        </p>

        <p>
          When clients are expecting a URL that is an OSLC 2.0 Service Provider document, they will clearly find a
          resource of type <code>oslc:ServiceProvider</code> and in-lined resources of type <code>oslc:Service</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          When clients are expecting a URL that is an OSLC 3.0 server, they will clearly find a resource of type or
          subtype of <code>ldp:Container</code>.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Creation of resources of a certain type</h2>
        <p>
          Based on the approach illustrated in the previous section to determine which version of server you are
          connected to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In 2.0, the client will look into an oslc:Server resource, then domain type, then creation factory and
            finally the type associated with it.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 3.0, the client will
            <a href="https://tools.oasis-open.org/version-control/svn/oslc-core/trunk/specs/discovery.html#creation"
              >inspect the response headers</a
            >.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Making server that works with either 2.0 or 3.0 clients</h2>

      <section>
        <h2>Server/endpoint discovery</h2>
        <p>
          OSLC 2.0 clients should provide a HTTP request header of <code>OSLC-Core-Version: 2.0</code> which servers can
          respond with a 2.0 only response.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the <code>OSLC-Core-Version</code> header is not provided on HTTP requests or the value is "3.0", servers
          can assume the client is at least a 3.0 client and prefer 3.0-only responses.
        </p>

        <p>
          Optionally, a server can detect when a client uses a URL to make a request for a different version of a
          resource than the server is expecting. The server can redirect the client to the appropriate URL, using the
          appropriate HTTP 3xx range redirect codes such as 301 (Moved permanently).
        </p>

        <p>
          Additionally, servers could decide to expose additional HTTP response headers, RDF triples and HTTP OPTIONS
          responses to provide a single view of a given resource URL that may have been reserved for a given 2.0 or 3.0
          concept. There may be advantages to reusing URLs say for 2.0 creation factories and 3.0 LDP Containers, though
          in some cases there may be some drawbacks.

        request that and use that. Client applications has stored these references:

        <p>
          In OSLC Core 2.0 based specifications, OSLC Servers (Providers) would be required to expose a resource which
          has an <code>rdf:type</code> of <code>oslc:ServiceProvider</code>.

      <h2>OSLC-Core-Version</h2>
      <p>
        Deprecated. Technically, there is no reason to carry it forward in 3.0. Each capability should be able to
        independently describe how to discover it using methods established by LDP such as HTTP response headers (Link
        relations, Accept-Post, ...) [[OSLCDiscovery3]].
      </p>
      <p>
        Implementations that have previously tested for the value of this parameter, should ensure their logic properly
        accounts for values that may not be "2.0". As some may provide the value of "3.0", which shouldn't be seen as an
        error but instead as just an informative header.

      <h2>Resource Preview</h2>
      <p>
        There are key differences between resource preview in OSLC 2.0 [[OSLCUIPreview20]] and OSLC 3.0
        [[OSLCPreview3]]. How Consumers request previews and their media types have changed. OSLC 3.0 changes some
        aspects of preview sizing as well.

        <h2>Discovery and Resource Representation</h2>
        <p>
          The <code>application/x-oslc-compact+xml</code> media type is no longer used. Previews are instead discovered
          using HTTP <code>Link</code> headers or by making GET requests for the target resource with an HTTP
          <code>Prefer</code> header. Additionally, the response is no longer XML. Instead Compact resources have JSON
          or Turtle [[turtle]] representations.
        </p>

        <p>Below are OSLC 2.0 and OSLC 3.0 examples for comparison.</p>

          <h2>Discovery in OSLC 2.0</h2>

          <p>
            OSLC 2.0 defined a special media type for its XML Compact representation. Even though it appears to be
            RDF/XML, only a specific XML format is allowed.

          <h2>Discovery in OSLC 3.0</h2>

          <p>
            OSLC 3.0 treats Compact as a distinct resource, rather than a representation. You can request it in one HTTP
            request using a <code>Prefer</code> header. The response can be JSON or an RDF format like Turtle, depending
            on the <code>Accept</code> header.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Request:</strong></p>

          <pre class="example" id="preferExample">

        }
    }
}
</pre
          >

          <p>
            Another way to discover the Compact resource is by looking for a <code>Link</code> header, which is required
            in OSLC 3.0.

        <h2>Preview Sizing</h2>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Resize messages for previews now use <code>oslc-resize</code> messages, the same as dialogs, and can set
            both a height and a width. OSLC 2.0 used <code>oslc-preview-height</code>, which was inconsistent with
            dialogs and only allowed changing heights. Note that the width and height in an
            <code>oslc:resize</code> message must use [[CSS2]] length units, unlike <code>oslc-preview-height</code>,
            which was always pixels.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>oslc:initialHeight</code> and <code>oslc:initialWidth</code> are no longer properties on the
            <code>oslc:Compact</code> resource. Instead use <code>oslc:hintHeight</code> and
            <code>oslc:hintWidth</code>. Resize messages can be sent regardless of whether size hints were provided.
          </li>
          <li>
            Any [[CSS2]] length unit can be used for <code>oslc:hintHeight</code> and <code>oslc:hintWidth</code>, not
            just relative length units. <code>px</code> is fair game.
