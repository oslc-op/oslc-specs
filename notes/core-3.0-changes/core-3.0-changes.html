    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>We are happy to announce a publication of OSLC 3.0, the next
    generation of the core OSLC specification, as the OASIS Standard.
    The specification in full can be viewed freely <a
    href="https://docs.oasis-open-projects.org/oslc-op/core/v3.0/os/oslc-core.html">online</a>
    and this note will serve as a guide for existing OSLC 2.0 users to
    learn what’s new and navigate around the changes in the
    specifications.</p>
    <p>The OSLC Core 2.0 evolution from 1.0 strengthened its definition
    of the use of RESTful HTTP web services and adopted an existing
    standard-based approach to representing a data model that was
    flexible and had multiple representation formats, namely RDF. A
    primary goal of OSLC Core 3.0 was upwards compatibility with OSLC
    2.0, preserving the investment in existing implementations. Most
    OSLC Core 3.0 changes are optional and OSLC 2.0 servers will not be
    mandated to adopt them to be compliant with 3.0. In most cases,
    existing OSLC 2.0 clients should be able to consume OSLC 3.0 servers
    with no changes. This should result in a less disruptive change from
    2.0 to 3.0. This document provides a summary of the changes in OSLC
    Core 3.0 with respect to OSLC Core 2.0.</p>
    <p>From the standardization point of view, there have been two major
    changes in OSLC 3.0 that further the openness of OSLC and strengthen
    its integration value. First, the specification development was
    moved to OASIS, a vendor-neutral standardization body with a proven
    track record of assisting in the publication of standards that are
    widely adopted and further standardized by international bodies like
    ISO (e.g. <a
    href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v5.0/mqtt-v5.0.html">MQTT</a>,
    <a
    href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=office">ODF
    (ISO/IEC 26300-1:2015)</a>). Throughout the development of the
    specifications, our member section at OASIS featured as many as <a
    href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170814105435/http://www.oasis-oslc.org:80/members">16
    members</a> before executing a transition to an Open Project that
    has drastically lowered the bar to <a
    href="https://github.com/oslc-op/oslc-admin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">entry</a>.
    Second, the OSLC 3.0 specification is now aligned with the <a
    href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/">Linked Data Platform 1.0</a>, a
    W3C Recommendation, that was adopted by projects such as <a
    href="https://solidproject.org/">Solid</a>, focused on
    decentralizing data storage and spearheaded by Sir Tim Berners-Lee,
    the founding father of the Web.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="resource-representations" class="level2">
    <h2>Resource representations</h2>
    <p>OSLC Core 2.0 mandates support for RDF/XML
    (<code>application/rdf+xml</code>) and made support for other RDF
    formats optional. OSLC Core 3.0 requires that servers support at
    least one RDF format, and recommends servers support RDF/XML, Turtle
    (<code>text/turtle</code>), and JSON-LD
    (<code>application/ld+json</code>), and use standard HTTP content
    negotiation in choosing which RDF format to return. Turtle is the
    preferred format used for examples in OSLC 3.0 specifications.
    Clients that specify both RDF/XML and Turtle formats in an
    <code>Accept</code> request header are likely to operate with both
    OSLC 2.0 and 3.0 servers without change. New clients that
    <em>only</em> accept Turtle might not work with older OSLC 2.0
    servers that might only support RDF/XML.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="oslc-discovery" class="level2">
    <h2>OSLC Discovery</h2>
    <p>The discovery mechanisms defined in OSLC Core 2.0 for discovering
    OSLC service provider catalogs, service providers, services,
    creation factories, selection dialogs, and query capabilities
    continue to be supported in OSLC Core 3.0. If new OSLC 3.0 server
    implementations continue to support these discovery mechanisms, they
    should be consumable by existing OSLC 2.0 clients.</p>
    <p>OSLC Core 3.0 extends OSLC 2.0 Discovery to allow servers to
    optionally support the use of OPTIONS and <code>Link</code> headers
    as an alternative mechanism to discover creation factories,
    selection dialogs, and resource preview. OSLC Core 3.0 further
    specifies well-known URIs registered with accordance to the <a
    href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8615">RFC 8615</a>
    for probing the existence of OSLC Service Provider Catalogs as well
    as Jazz RootServices documents at well-known URIs.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="creation-factories" class="level2">
    <h2>Creation factories</h2>
    <p>Creation factories in OSLC Core 3.0 are upwards compatible with
    Core 2.0 and existing OSLC 2.0 clients should be able to consume
    creation factories in an OSLC 3.0 server.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="delegated-dialogs" class="level2">
    <h2>Delegated dialogs</h2>
    <p>OSLC Core 3.0 continues to support the use of delegated dialogs
    for creation and/or selection, and existing OSLC 2.0 clients should
    be able to consume these without change where these are declared in
    OSLC services.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="query-capabilities" class="level2">
    <h2>Query capabilities</h2>
    <p>In OSLC Core 2.0, the use of query capabilities was defined by a
    section on discovery and a separate document on query syntax. In
    OSLC Core 3.0, there is a separate OSLC Query 3.0 specification that
    covers usage and query syntax, and describes the changes from, and
    compatibility with, query in OSLC Core 2.0. OSLC 2.0 clients should
    be able to consume query capabilities in an OSLC 3.0 server without
    change.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="prefixes" class="level2">
    <h2>Prefixes</h2>
    <p>OSLC Core 2.0 did not define a minimum set of prefixes that OSLC
    servers should predefine and declare in services. OSLC Core 3.0
    defines a set of recommended predefined prefixes. Existing servers
    are not required to implement this to be compliant with OSLC Core
    3.0, but it is recommended they do so for convenience to
    clients.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="resource-paging" class="level2">
    <h2>Resource Paging</h2>
    <p>Resource paging is unchanged in OSLC Core 3.0 with respect to
    Core 2.0.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="resource-preview" class="level2">
    <h2>Resource preview</h2>
    <p>In OSLC Core 2.0, clients can request a compact representation of
    a resource using <code>Accept=application/x-oslc-compact+xml</code>.
    This continues to be supported in OSLC Core 3.0. OSLC 3.0 servers
    that support this functionality will work with OSLC 2.0 clients.</p>
    <p>OSLC Core 3.0 also supports a new way of discovering and
    consuming compact data for resource preview. An OSLC 3.0 server can
    include a <code>Link</code> header where the link relation is
    <code>http://open-services.net/ns/core#Compact</code> and the target
    URI is the URI of a compact resource. This also supports getting a
    compact representation in JSON. OSLC 2.0 clients won’t be aware of
    the new <code>Link</code> header and hence will not be impacted by
    this change.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="shapes-and-vocabularies" class="level2">
    <h2>Shapes and vocabularies</h2>
    <p>Resource shapes in OSLC Core 3.0 are upwards compatible with
    those defined in OSLC Core 2.0. Core 3.0 supports some additional
    optional constraints that include: 1. On a resource shape,
    <code>oslc:hidden</code> may be used to indicate the type should be
    hidden. Some OSLC 2.0 servers may have implemented this prior to its
    inclusion in OSLC Core 3.0. 2. On a property,
    <code>oslc:queryable</code> may be used to indicate whether a
    property is queryable and can be specified in an
    <code>oslc.where</code> query expression.</p>
    <p>OSLC Core 3.0 provides separately fetchable files for resource
    shapes defined in the specification. These may be fetched as RDF (in
    RDF/XML or Turtle formats) or as rendered HTML using standard HTTP
    content negotiation. The OSLC Core 3.0 vocabulary and constraints
    multi-part specification documents are generated from these RDF
    ResourceShape constraint representations.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="authentication" class="level2">
    <h2>Authentication</h2>
    <p>OSLC Core 2.0 supports the use of HTTP Basic Authentication,
    OAuth (1.0), or both. OSLC Core 3.0 recommends that servers support
    OAuth 2.0 and OpenIdConnect, and only support HTTP Basic
    Authentication via SSL. Existing clients that support none of these
    may be unable to use an OSLC 3.0 server.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="cors-protocol" class="level2">
    <h2>CORS protocol</h2>
    <p>OSLC Core 2.0 did not address the issue of new security
    constraints being imposed by some web browsers to limit the loading
    of resources with cross-origin. See <a
    href="https://%5Bhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing">Cross-origin
    resource sharing</a>. An example is where a dialog served by one
    application embeds content from another application, such as in an
    iFrame. OSLC Core 3.0 recommends that servers support the CORS
    protocol to address these emerging security requirements.</p>
