    <h1 class="informative">Introduction</h1>
    <p>Linking profiles are non-normative supplement to OSLC
    specifications, aiming to ensure interoperability between OSLC
    enabled applications when linking across applications, domains, and
    heterogenious domain providers. It is important to note that OSLC
    interoperability is not automatically implied by OSLC
    specifications, as the specifications allow for high degree of
    conformance variability.</p>
    <p>Linking use cases result in establishing OSLC links across OSLC
    resources in different applications, possibly within the same OSLC
    domain or across domains. For example, a requirements provider from
    one vendor establishes traceability links to a requirements provider
    from another vendor. A cross domain example would be a PLM BOM
    application establishing traceability links to a requirements
    application by a different vendor. The cross vendors emphasis is
    because this is the context for interoperability challenges. Linking
    use cases may vary in capability as described later in this
    document, but all linking use cases require establishing connections
    between the resources in the consumer and provider applications,
    ability to select a resource with the provider to link with a
    resource of the consumer, and storage of the link in one of the
    applications. From that point onwards there is a variability across
    the use cases related to bi-directional navigability (are both
    applications aware of the link) and also behaviors that depend if
    the application supports configuration management or not.</p>
    <p>The introduction of the profile comes to help users qualify
    whether two OSLC applications meet compatibility level to perform a
    set of use OSLC linking cases, and software vendors on how to
    build/consume OSLC linking related services that ensure
    interoperability.</p>
    <p>The linking profiles specify 4 (3+1 future) levels of
    conformance, each aims at certain implementation level and set of
    linking use cases, and can also be related to “OSLC maturity” usage.
    The profiles should be based on accumulated practice. Since IBM ELM
    has the longest and broadest OSLC integration adoptions of OSLC
    integrations, IBM ELM is used as a baseline for spec variability
    choices, so the profiles will ensure ELM linking interoperability.
    However, the profiles are meant provide an interoperability baseline
    to any other vendor and future interoperability related or unrelated
    to IBM OSLC applications.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="motivation" class="level1">
    <h1>Motivation</h1>
    <section id="the-problem" class="level2">
    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>The fundamental set of interoperability use cases in the context
    of OSLC linked data architecture describe cross linking across
    lifecycle resources and domain providers. Cross linking forms the
    foundation for “digital continuity” and establishment of “digital
    threads”. Using linking profiles guarantees a set of use cases
    across providers implemented by different software vendors.</p>
    <p>When originally developed, the OSLC specifications (Core, GCM)
    were purposefully kept general avoiding over-prescription. The
    intent was to allow a considerable degree of implementation
    variability to speed vendor adoption as well as let adopting vendors
    identify areas (though their adoption) that needed more
    prescription.by. This is reflected in the minimal set of mandatory
    (“must”) services , and rest that are only recommended
    (“should”).</p>
    <p>The goal of interoperability across different vendor OSLC
    specification implementations requires peer to peer testing and
    adjustments to satisfy certain common interoperability use cases.
    Also, implementors complain that practically implementing
    interoperable OSLC providers or consumers is very time consuming and
    requires lots of discovery, trial and error. Additionally, when
    vendors label their applications as “OSLC compliant”, the possible
    implementation variability makes that label definition very broad
    becoming difficult for end users to know for certain what aspects of
    interoperability exist.</p>
    <p>In addition to the variability caused by the mandatory/optional
    requirements, implementors also struggle to follow the specification
    without detailed explanations or examples. Unfortunately, while some
    guides exist, they are not always known about or found, requiring
    web searches. In some cases, guides simply do not exist.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="solution-scope" class="level2">
    <h2>Solution scope</h2>
    <p>Specify profiles based on maturity and use cases to reduce
    interoperability variability across providers complying to a
    specific profile, and provide guidance with examples to eliminate
    ambiguities and confusion related to the implementation of the
    specifications. A key aspect of reducing spec variabilities is
    converting “should” clauses in the spec to “must” in certain
    profiles. Guidance may be reference existing articles and/or include
    a supplementary spec in the profile.</p>
    <p>As agreed in preliminary discussions, the linking profiles will
    accommodate various degrees of maturity and need of OSLC
    implementations, that are based on two key characteristics related
    to providers/consumers:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The need to maintain bi-directional navigability or not</li>
    <li>Usage of configuration management by the provider or not</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Based on that we aim to specify 3+1 profiles as follows</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Basic</strong>: focuses on establishing links to a
    provider, without bi-directional navigation. The main objective of
    this profile is to establish proper connection with a provider by a
    consumer and obtaining a resource selection UI. The challenges
    related to the basic profile are around establishing OSLC connection
    with a provider with proper authentication and discovery of
    services.</li>
    <li><strong>Bi-directional</strong>: this profile extends the
    capabilities of the basic profile, but in addition it should result
    in by-directional navigation across the two applications. It also
    requires conformance with the basic profile but requires additional
    capabilities. This profile needs to clarify where a physical link is
    actually stored, and how the non-storing application can discover
    incoming links. The issues related to this profile are around link
    storage, discovery, and OSLC query.</li>
    <li><strong>Config management Linking</strong>: Linking across
    configuration management enabled OSLC providers. This profile
    extends the bi-directional profile with additional guidance in case
    of the application enables OSLC configuration management.</li>
    <li><strong>Full</strong>: This profile is future and is not
    currently feasible, as it depends on future standardization of a
    link discovery service. It aims to prescribe providers on how to use
    an incoming link service if one exists, to optimize incoming links
    discovery, on top of the config management linking profile.</li>

    <p>A OSLC server MUST register Dialog discovery service using
    oslc:selectionDialog property with a service provider. A OSLC
    consumer discovers the service by looking for oslc:selectionDialog
    property and making a GET request on the service resource OR Clients
    can also use the HTTP Prefer header to find the dialogs for a
    container.The server responds with the dialog descriptors in the
    response body OR The client discovers the dialogs by making an HTTP
    OPTIONS request on the container and the server response contains a
    Link header with URLs to the dialog descriptors.</p>
    <p>OSLC server MUST provide a dialog, an HTML page for resource
    selection, search and select remote resources. Selection dialog
    provides OSLC consumers to search and select resources, to create
    trace links. Selection Dialog MUST accept user input and to filter
    out resources on basis of user input and MUST display filtered
    resources. Selection Dialogs MUST provide a way to user to select
    filtered resources and submit their selection. Once user selection
    is submitted, Dialogs send selected resource URI as result back to
    the client using the HTML5 function Window.postMessage
    [whatwg-web-messaging]. postMessage is called on window.opener if
    set. Otherwise, postMessage is called on window.parent.</p>
    <p>OSLC client MUST Open the dialog in a new window or embed the
    dialog in an iframe. Selection Dialog consumer MUST add a message
    listener to receive messages from the dialog. When message from the
    dialog indicates a completed action, OSLC Consumer SHOULD free
    resources and MUST handle the action.</p>

    <section id="link-ownership" class="level1">
    <h1>Link Ownership</h1>
    <p>In bi-dirctional linking scenarios both OSLC participants are
    aware of links across their owned resources and enable link
    visibility and navigation on each side. Nevertheless storing a link
    at both sides is considered bad-practice as it is essentially
    replication of data. This may result in inconsistencies as links are
    updated or deleted, since maintaining consistency requires
    synchronization across the providers on any update. Therefore the
    recommended practice is to store links on one of the participants,
    and use link discovery by the other participant. Therefore there
    need to be an agreed convention on which side should store the
    link.</p>
    <p>Many OSLC links have an incoming and outgoing sides, determined
    by the role of the link. Usually one side will have an active
    predicate name, for example, “implements” and the other side will
    have a passive predicate name, in this example it would be
    “implemented by”. The active side is often considered the outgoing
    side, and the passive the incoming side. The convention is that the
    link is typically stored with the resource on the outgoing side,
    i.e., the resource with the active predicate. The incoming side
    would discover the links with one of the discovery methods discussed
    in the following sections.</p>
    <p>Note the creation of the link can be initiated by both providers.
    In case that the link is initiated by the incoming side provider, it
    needs to store it with the resource on the outgoing side provider.
    This is discussed in the PUT on Resources section. In addition, for
    historical reasons, certain OSLC providers, such as IBM ELM, may
    have some variations of behaviors between configuration enabled and
    non-configuration enabled modes, where in non-configuration modes
    there may still be a usage of backlink storage. In addition,
    providers do not support configurations such as CM (change
    management providers) would have preference for link storage over
    configuration enabled providers, to prevent baselined links to refer
    to mutable entities.</p>
    <p>Based on these principles and conventions, the Linking Profile
    establishes specific ownership for OSLC link properties.</p>
