    <h1 class="informative">Introduction</h1>
    <p>Linking profiles are non-normative supplement to OSLC
    specifications, aiming to ensure interoperability between OSLC
    enabled applications when linking across applications, domains, and
    heterogenious domain providers. It is important to note that OSLC
    interoperability is not automatically implied by OSLC
    specifications, as the specifications allow for high degree of
    conformance variability.</p>
    <p>Linking use cases result in establishing OSLC links across OSLC
    resources in different applications, possibly within the same OSLC
    domain or across domains. For example, a requirements provider from
    one vendor establishes traceability links to a requirements provider
    from another vendor. A cross domain example would be a PLM BOM
    application establishing traceability links to a requirements
    application by a different vendor. The cross vendors emphasis is
    because this is where there are interoperability challenges. Linking
    use cases may vary in capability as described later in this
    document, but all linking use cases require establishing connections
    between the resources in the consumer and provider applications,
    ability to select a resource with the provider to link with a
    resource of the consumer, and storage of the link in one of the
    applications. From that point onwards there is a variability across
    the use cases related to bi-directional navigability (are both
    applications aware of the link) and also behaviors that depend if
    the application supports configuration management or not.</p>
    <p>The introduction of the linking profile helps users qualify
    whether two OSLC applications meet a compatibility level to perform
    a set of OSLC linking use cases. The linking profile also helps
    software vendors to know how to build/consume OSLC linking related
    services that ensure interoperability.</p>
    <p>The linking profiles specify 4 (3+1 future) levels of
    conformance. Each aims at certain implementation level and set of
    linking use cases, and can also be considered as “OSLC maturity
    levels”. The profiles are based on common practice. Since IBM ELM
    has the longest and broadest OSLC integration adoptions of OSLC
    integrations, IBM ELM is used as a baseline for spec variability
    choices, so the profiles will ensure ELM linking interoperability.
    However, the profiles are meant provide an interoperability baseline
    to any other vendor and future interoperability related or unrelated
    to IBM OSLC applications.</p>
    <section id="motivation" class="level2">
    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>The fundamental set of interoperability use cases in the context
    of OSLC linked data architecture describe cross linking across
    lifecycle resources and domain providers. Cross linking forms the
    foundation for “digital continuity” and establishment of “digital
    threads”. Using linking profiles guarantees a set of use cases
    across providers implemented by different software vendors.</p>
    <p>When originally developed, the OSLC specifications (Core, RM, CM,
    QM, AM, GCM) were purposefully kept general avoiding
    over-prescription. The intent was to allow a considerable degree of
    implementation variability to speed vendor adoption as well as let
    adopting vendors identify areas (though their adoption) that needed
    more prescription.by. This is reflected in the minimal set of
    mandatory (“MUST”) services , and rest that are only recommended
    (“SHOULD”) or optional (“MAY”).</p>
    <p>The goal of interoperability across different vendor OSLC
    specification implementations requires peer to peer testing and
    adjustments to satisfy certain common interoperability use cases.
    Also, implementors complain that practically implementing
    interoperable OSLC providers or consumers is very time consuming and
    requires lots of discovery, trial and error. Additionally, when
    vendors label their applications as “OSLC compliant”, the possible
    implementation variability makes that label definition very broad
    becoming difficult for end users to know for certain what optional
    capabilities are supported that impact interoperability.</p>
    <p>In addition to the variability caused by the mandatory/optional
    requirements, implementors also struggle to follow the specification
    without detailed explanations or examples. Unfortunately, while some
    guides exist, they are not always known about or found, requiring
    web searches. In some cases, guides simply do not exist. While OSLC
    does define discovery services, OSLC discovery does not provide a
    machine readable, standard way to determine which optional OSLC
    features a server implements. This has to be manually documented by
    server providers, and may not be easily reflected from the server’s
    APIs.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="solution-scope" class="level2">
    <h2>Solution scope</h2>
    <p>The linking profile specifies profiles based on maturity and use
    cases to reduce interoperability across clients and servers
    complying to a specific profile, and provides guidance with examples
    to eliminate ambiguities and confusion related to the implementation
    of the specifications. A key aspect of reducing spec variabilities
    is converting “SHOULD” and “MAY” clauses in the spec to “MUST” in
    certain profiles to ensure those features are implemented by the
    conforming servers. Guidance may be references existing articles
    and/or include supplementary information in the profile.</p>
    <p>To enable server implementation flexibility with more predicable
    variability, the linking profiles accommodate various degrees of
    maturity and needs of different OSLC server implementations. The
    profile conformance levels are based on two key characteristics
    related to providers/consumers:</p>
    <ol type="1">
    <li>The need to maintain bi-directional navigability or not</li>
    <li>Usage of configuration management by the provider or not</li>
    </ol>
    </section>
    </section>
    <section id="linking-profile-conformance-levels" class="level1">
    <h1>Linking Profile Conformance Levels</h1>
    <p>The integration challenges described above result from the amount
    of server implementation variability allowed by the OSLC
    specification, through the MAY and SHOULD conformance clauses. To
    simplify and improve interoperability across OSLC applications,
    while maintaining levels of variability that have been shown to be
    useful and effective in practice, the Linking Profile introduces the
    following conformance levels. Each level defines which capabilities
    are necessary to support the integration services specified for that
    level. This ensures that tools that advertise conformance to a
    Linking Profile level will have a predecitable, minimal viable set
    of capabilities that other clients and servers can rely on.</p>
    <section id="basic-linking-profile" class="level2">
    <h2>Basic Linking Profile</h2>
    <p>The <strong>Basic</strong>: Focuses on establishing links to a
    provider, without bi-directional navigation. The main objective of
    this profile is to establish proper connection with a provider by a
    consumer and obtaining a resource selection UI. The challenges
    related to the basic profile are around establishing OSLC connection
    with a provider with proper authentication and discovery of
    services.</p>
    <p>For the Basic RM/AM/QM/CM Linking profile 3,0, a user needs to be
    able to make a link from inside the web interface of Tool A to an
    RM/AM/QM/CM resource inside Tool B. The user does not have a link to
    the resource in advance. Instead, the user shall be able to pick a
    resource when establishing a link. After selecting the resource,
    Tool A shall store the link to the resource and display the link
    title and icon.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="bi-directional-linking-profile" class="level2">
    <h2>Bi-directional Linking Profile</h2>
    <p>The <strong>Bi-directional</strong>: profile extends the
    capabilities of the Basic profile, with the ability to have
    by-directional navigation across the two applications, and the
    ability to preview linked resources in different applications.</p>
    <p>For the Bidirectional RM/AM/QM/CM Linking profile 3.0, a user
    needs to be able to make a link from inside the web interface of
    Tool A to an RM/AM/QM/CM resource inside Tool B. The user does not
    have a link to the resource in advance. Instead, the user shall be
    able to pick a resource when establishing a link. After selecting
    the resource, the link is either stored in Tool A and/or in Tool B
    depending on the domain model requirements or how the tools support
    primary and secondary links. When a user navigates to one of the
    linked resources in a tool that does not store the link, the
    backlink or secondary link is shown.</p>
    <p>Additionally, when the user of the Tool A hovers over a link to
    the resource, a preview dialog is shown next to the link.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="configuration-management-linking-profile"
    class="level2">
    <h2>Configuration Management Linking Profile</h2>
    <p>The <strong>Config management Linking</strong>: extends the
    Bi-directional linking profile with support for linking across
    configuration management enabled OSLC providers. This profile
    clarifies where a physical link is actually stored, and how the
    non-storing application can discover incoming links. The issues
    related to this profile are around link storage, discovery, and OSLC
    query.</p>
    <p>For the Configuration-aware RM/AM/QM/CM Linking profile 3.0, the
    Bidirectional RM/AM/QM/CM Linking profile 3.0 applies. Additionally,
    both tools are configured with OSLC Configuration Management
    enabled.</p>
    <p>Additionally, when the user of the Tool A hovers over a link to
    the resource, the preview dialog is shown next to the link and
    displays correct information for the configuration context
    chosen.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="link-discovery-linking-profile" class="level2">
    <h2>Link Discovery Linking Profile</h2>
    <p>The <strong>Link Discovery</strong>: profile extends the
    Configuration Management Linking Profile with a link discovery
    service for accessing incoming links.</p>
    <p>For the Link Discovery RM/AM/QM/CM Linking profile 3.0, the
    Configuration-aware RM/AM/QM/CM Linking profile 3.0 applies.
    Additionally, Additionally, all tools contribute outgoing links to a
    Link Discovery Management server, and get all incoming links from a
    Link Discovery Management server.</p>

    Version 3.0. Part 1: Overview</a> recommends specific approaches for
    authentication and secure communication between clients and servers,
    as well as between servers. These align with the industry best
    practices for RESTful APIs and linked data at the time the OSLC Core
    specification was developed.</p>
    <p>However, the OSLC Core authentication recommendations have proven
    to be insufficiently specific to facilitiate secure integration
    scenarios that required authentication and authorization. As a
    result, a signifiant barrier developing and using OSLC integrations
    has been establishing authentication and authorization. Since OSLC

    Security Policy (CSP)</a> is a web security standard that helps
    protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) and other code injection
    attacks. It works by giving website developers control over which
    resources (scripts, images, etc.) the browser is allowed to load and
    execute for a given page. By whitelisting trusted sources, CSP helps
    prevent browsers from loading malicious or untrusted content, even
    if a user has been tricked into visiting a compromised website.</p>
    <p><span class="conformance">An OSLC Server MUST support the CSP
    Content-Security-Policy HTTP response header so that modern browsers
    can use it to enhance the security of the HTTP entity response
    resource.</span> The Content-Security-Policy header allows servers
    to restrict which resources (such as JavaScript, CSS, Images, etc.)
    can be loaded, and the URLs that they can be loaded from.</p>
    <p>For example, this response header:</p>
    <pre><code>Content-Security-Policy: default-src &#39;self&#39;; img-src &#39;self&#39; cdn.example.com;</code></pre>

    <h1>CORS for friends</h1>
    <p>CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security mechanism that
    allows or restricts web applications running in a browser to make
    requests to a different domain (origin) than the one they originated
    from. This is commonly used in OSLC resource preview and delegated
    selection and creation dialogs where an OSLC client running in a
    HTTP browser needs to access resources from multiple servers. This
    is required to allow the creation and navigation of links between
    resources in different OSLC servers.</p>
    <p>By default, browsers block web pages from making requests to a
    different domain (origin) for security. CORS identifies the request
    origin as a combination of the protocol (http/https), host domain
    (example.com) and port (:8080).</p>
    <p>CORS provide a means for clients and servers to control the
    Same-Origin Policy to allow controlled cross-origin requests. When a
    browser makes a cross-origin request, it first sends a preflight
    request (OPTIONS) to check if the server allows it. The server
    responds with CORS headers indicating permitted origins, methods,
    and headers. This ensures that only cross-origin requests that have
    been explicitly configured are permitted.</p>

    <p>In bi-dirctional linking scenarios both OSLC participants are
    aware of links across their owned resources and enable link
    visibility and navigation on each side. In the Bi-Directional
    profile, OSLC Servers can support bi-directional links, links in the
    form of (source, primary-predicate, target) and {target,
    secondary-predicate, source) however they wish. This could be done
    for example by storing backlinks, or using queries to get links.
    However, storing a link and a backlink at both sides does not follow
    <a
    href="https://docs.oasis-open-projects.org/oslc-op/link-guidance/v1.0/pn01/link-guidance.html">OSLC
    Link Guidance</a> as it is essentially replication of data. This may
    result in inconsistencies as links are updated or deleted, since
    maintaining consistency requires synchronization across the
    providers on any update. Therefore the recommended practice is to
    store links on one of the participants, and use link discovery by
    the other participant. Therefore there needs to be an agreed
    convention on which side should store the link.</p>
    <p>Many OSLC links have an incoming and outgoing sides, determined
    by the direction of the link. Usually one side will have an active
    predicate name, for example, “implements” and the other side will
    have a passive predicate name, such as for example “implemented by”.
    The active side is often considered the outgoing side, and the
    passive the incoming side. The convention is that the link is
    typically stored with the resource on the outgoing side, i.e., the
    resource with the active predicate. The incoming side would discover
    the links with one of the discovery methods discussed in the
    following sections.</p>
    <p>Note the creation of the link can be initiated from the OSLC
    server at either end of the link. In case that the link is initiated
    by the incoming side provider, it needs to store it with the
    resource on the outgoing side provider. This is discussed in the PUT
    on Resources section. In addition, for historical reasons, certain
    OSLC providers, such as IBM ELM, may have some variations of
    behaviors between configuration enabled and non-configuration
    enabled modes, where in non-configuration modes there may still be a
    usage of backlink storage. In addition, providers do not support
    OSLC versioned resources such as CM (change management servers)
    would have preference for link storage over configuration enabled
    providers, to prevent baselined links to refer to mutable
    entities.</p>
    <p>Based on these principles and conventions, the Linking Profile
    establishes specific ownership for OSLC link properties.

    <p>All links are directional from source to target e.g., Requirement
    testedBy TestCase, TestCase validates Requirement. OSLC does not
    define inverse links, however, links are often paired using
    active/passive names as in implements/implementedBy,
    validates/testedBy, etc.</p>
    <p>There is some interest in extending OSLC ResourceShapes to
    formalize these active/passive relationships between link types so
    their property URLs and titles can be discovered in a standard
    way.</p>
    <p>Links have to be created between existing source and target
    resources (the targets either already exist and are selected, or are
    created before the link is created).</p>
    <p>Links are only stored in the source resource on one side (usually
    the active side) of related link types. The “inverse” or incoming
    link is typically displayed, but is obtained through a query rather
    than being stored. This avoids storing redundant data that can lead
    to update anomalies.</p>
    <p>By convention, links are stored on the “downstream” side, i.e.,
    the resource that is created later in the lifecycle. This ensures
    that both the source and target of the link are likely to exist when
    the link is created. For example, in
    Requirements-Driven-Development, requirements are created first, and
    then later in the lifecycle, test cases are created that validate
    the requirements. When the test case is created, the requirement
    will most likely already exist, so the link is stored in the
    downstream test case source as TestCase validates Requirement.</p>
    <p>Note however that if an organization used
    Test-Driven-Development, test cases are often created first,
    representing an executable expression of a requirement that might be
    identified and refined later. So the convention to store RM/QM links
    on the QM side is not always ideal, but does provide consistency
    that improves and simplifies overall tool integration.</p>
    <p>Storing related links on only one side is also necessary when
    using configuration management since it must be possible to create a
    link from a source to a target resource without changing the target
    resource version (it could be in a baseline).</p>
    <p>For example, the requirements for a project may have already been
    created and baselined before test cases are created. Then when the
    test cases are created, they can be linked to the requirement they
    validate without changing the requirement.</p>
    <p>Similarly, a versioned resource cannot store links to unversioned
    resources because it would be impossible to create an immutable
    baseline of such a resource since the target unverioned resource
    could changed or deleted, indirectly modifying an immutable source
    resource.</p>

    before they create test cases to validate them, thus ensuring the
    requirements exist when the user cratest the
    oslc_qm:validatesRequirement link. However, test-driven development
    methodologies might create the test cases first, perhaps as an
    executable representation of a requirment that can be then
    elaborated with additional oslc_rm:validatedBy requirements.</p>
    <p>But implementing the linking profiles does not restrict severs to
    follow specific, overly rigid methodologies: 1. Selection and
    Creation dialogs can be used to create primary or secondary links
    from either side 2. The PUT operations allows a server that doesn’t
    own the link to add the link to the resource owned by another server
    and ask that server to update its resource. 3. The link ownership
    table specifies what server owns what links, and the primary and
    secondary link predicates so that server implementors know how to
    create links regardless of which server owns them. 4. The Link
    Discovery Management provides an efficient means for accessing
    incoming links in a standard way.</p>
    <p>So link ownership, or where links are stored, can be transparent
    to users, while being predicatable for different server
    implementations to ensure consistent integrations of versioned links
    across OSLC domains and servers.</p>
    <p>Users should typically not be aware of where links are stored,
    and should be able to create links from either direction in a
    transparent way. For primary links the server owns, the server can
    easily create, store, access, navigate and display these links.
    However, for secondary link, the information is stored in a
    different server, and to display them, a server would need to access
    incoming links, the links for which its resource is the source of
    the link.</p>
    <p>Servers can use OSLC query as a standard means of requesting
    incoming links. However, this does not scale well when a server has
    to access incoming links from many other servers.</p>
    <p>OSLC defines a <a
    href="https://docs.oasis-open-projects.org/oslc-op/ldm/v1.0/psd02/link-discovery-management-spec.html">Link
    Discovery Management specification</a> as a standard means of
    accessinig incoming versioned or unversioned links. Bi-Directional,
    Config and Full link profiles must support the LDM
    specification.</p>
