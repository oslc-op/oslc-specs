# Outline

1. an explanation of the concepts in the specs (streams, baselines, config context, etc), and how they relate to each other. The specs is very exact about a listing of each of these terms. But unless you are an expert, it is hard to get an overview, and understand the overall model behind it all.

2. an explanation of Global vs. Local Configuration. What role does each play in a toolchain? Which kinds of tool should implement which part?

3. For someone trying to implement CCM for any given tool, a hands-on incremental introduction of the concepts
   * How to introduce simple linear version control
   * How to introduce branching
   * How to introduce baselines
   * etc.
