      <h1>Concepts</h1>
      <p>
        Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_management) defines Configuration Management as
        “Configuration management (CM) is a systems engineering process for establishing and maintaining consistency of
        a product’s performance, functional, and physical attributes with its requirements, design, and operational
        information throughout its life.”.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Configuration Management, artifacts are versioned. For example, a new requirement R1 might be defined and
        created. Once the content of that requirement is checked in or committed, version 1 of that requirement R1
        exists. At that point, the contents of version 1 cannot be changed. If changes are required, the content is
        changed, and when checked in or delivered, results in version 2 of requirement R1. Version 2 of R1 was created
        from, or derived from, version 1 of R1. The sequence of versions of that requirement comprise its
        <em>version history</em>. In OSLC Configuration Management, the term <em>concept resource</em> is used to mean
        all the versions of some artifact. In our example, requirement R1 is a concept resource (no version is
        specified), and requirement R1 version 1 is a specific version of that concept resource. Many versioning tools
        exist, and there are a number of different approaches as to how artifacts are versioned, when those versions are
        created, and when a version becomes non-modifiable. However, all tools support some notion of when a change is
        committed, the version that records that change becomes non-modifiable. The OSLC Configuration Management
        specification does not define how versioned should be implemented. Servers are free to choose existing
        versioning tools, or implement a versioning system of their own design.
      </p>
      <p>
        An important element of Configuration Management is a <em>configuration</em>. A configuration defines what set
        of versioned artifacts are used in that configuration. For example, configuration C1 might use version 1 of
        requirement R1, and configuration C2 might use version 2 of requirement R1. New artifacts might be added to or
        obsolete artifacts removed from a configuration. The configuration therefore provides a view of the appropriate
        artifacts and versions of those artifacts that apply in that configuration. The OSLC Configuration Management
        specification defines this in terms of <em>selections</em>. A configuration might reference a
        <em>selection</em> that in turn references the specific versioned artifacts that belong in that configuration.
      </p>
      <p>
        In OSLC Configuration Management, a <em>stream</em> is a modifiable configuration in which artifacts may be
        added or removed, or a different version of an artifact may be selected by a user to replace some other version
        of that artifact. Streams are the configurations in which ongoing work is performed. An essential element of
        Configuration Management is the ability to create a non-modifiable record of the set of versioned artifacts at
        specific milestones or points in time in order to provide traceability and auditing. In OSLC Configuration
        Management, a <em>baseline</em> is a non-modifiable configuration whose set of versioned artifacts are also
        non-modifiable. Usually a baseline is created from a stream, recording the state of that stream. The stream
        continues to be modifiable, but the baseline is now a non-modifiable record of the state of the stream at the
        time the baseline was created. Every configuration is associated with a <em>component</em>. A
        <em>component</em> is a unit of organization consisting of a set of version resources. When a
        <em>baseline</em> is created from a <em>stream</em>, both the baseline and the stream are for the same
        <em>component</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        OSLC Configuration Management supports the idea that a configuration may be a container of other configurations.
        The term <em>contribution</em> describes a configuration that is used by a parent configuration. Configurations
        may thus form a <em>hierarchy</em> of configurations. The term <em>global configuration</em> is used to describe
        a configuration that aggregates configurations, especially those from other configuration management servers.
        For example, a global configuration might have contributions from a requirements management server, a quality
        management server, and a source code control server. The global configuration thus represents the state of
        version artifacts across those application servers.

        Versioning support is the most basic functionanlity. We will start exploring support for versioning. The value
        here would be limited: a server could express different versions of each concept resource, and have these
        versions related into predecessor/successor history graphs. But the server would have no defined way to resolve
        concept resources to versions. This will be dealt with in the tutorial part that follows.
      </p>

        <h2>Example</h2>
        <p>We will use this example throughout the exercise. This should be a class/object diagram.</p>
        <pre><code>Requirement_a
    id: a
    version: v23
    name: &quot;Requirement A&quot;
    description: &quot;A description of requirement A&quot;
    refines: Requirement_b

    id: b
    version: v34
    name: &quot;Requirement B&quot;
    description: &quot;A description of requirement B&quot;
    refines: Requirement_c</code></pre>
        <p>
          In most (if not all) versioning systems, each individual artefact is attributd with some version id. A version
          id can be: * local: where each artefact has its own versioning sequence, such as v1, v2, v3, etc. * global:
          where artects share a single versioning sequence. 2 artefcats that have the same version number implies that
          the versions were created as part of the same commit.

            let’s assume for now that the client (somehow) got hold of the URL for a specific version resource URL. When
            a client performs a GET request, the received response is
          </p>
          <pre><code>:conceptResourceA-v23

            This OSLC representation of the Requirement_a artefact would consist of two RDF resources: a Version

            Content to develop: * Give here a short explanation on the difference between Concept Resource and Version
            Resource. * explain the properties prov:wasRevisionOf, oslc_config:versionId. * explain how resources should
            link to each other. Should it be Version or Concept resource? this can be examplified using oslc_rm:refines
            in artefacts above. * The client can then navigate to the previous versions by following the
            prov:wasRevisionOf property. * The client can also navigate to the concept resource by making a GET request
            to the dcterms:isVersionOf property.

            What should the client obtain when the do a GET on the concept resource URI? Is this decided in the Specs?
            Or, is it up to the server to decide to - say - return the latest version of the resource? Is the response
            also 2 RDF resources: a Version and a Concept? or just a concept with all the latest information?

            The server so far can work with version resource URIs. But such a server would have no defined way to
            resolve concept resources to versions. To start with, we let the server invent its own ways to do this.
          </p>

        In the previous section, the server defined its own way to resolve concept resources to versions. We will here
        introduce the concept of “Conf Context” in order to … To start with, the server supports only local
        configurations (not global), only a single stream, with baselines of that single stream, so there is no
