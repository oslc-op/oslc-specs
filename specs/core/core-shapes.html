      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        RDF vocabularies define the terms and resources for a domain of interest, life-cycle management in the case of
        OSLC Core. These vocabularies are often specified in an open manner, without providing information such as
        property domain and range assertions, cardinalities, etc. This helps keep the vocabulary applicable for a wide
        range of uses and furthering integration with other vocabularies.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, it is often desirable to closed down a vocabulary with specific constraints to facilitate using the
        vocabulary for a specific purpose. This document specifies the constraints for using the OSLC Core vocabulary in
        OSLC.
        <span class="conformance"
          >Different sets of constraints MAY be applied to a vocabulary in order to tailor its use, without overly
          constraining the vocabulary for other usages.</span
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        These constraints apply to the core vocabulary defined in
        <a href="core-vocab.html">OSLC Core Version 3.0. Part 7: Vocabulary</a>.

        Unlike the rest of the Core specification, these properties change and grow as new common properties are added.
        The properties that we list here are available for use in OSLC domain specifications when defining OSLC
        resources, but this does not mean that they are required to be in OSLC resources. OSLC domain specifications
        decide which properties are allowed and required for resources needed to realize their use cases. The OSLC

          It is common to collect a series of comments on a lifecycle resource, often referred to as a discussion. For
          example: tasks, bug reports, requirements, assets and so on, are often collected across various types of
          resources such as project. A project might reflect the planning of work to deliver a product that realizes the
          requirements as validated through test cases and bug reports. Discussions allow users to collaborate with each
          other for more efficient and effective delivery. This Discussion resource definition provides a minimal shape

      <p>
        The shape of an RDF resource is a description of the set of triples it is expected to contain and the integrity
        constraints those triples are required to satisfy. Applications of shapes include validating RDF data,
        documenting RDF APIs, and providing meta-data to tools, such as form and query builders, that handle RDF data.

        <p>
          The <code>oslc:AttachmentDescriptor</code> resource type is used to describe the binary resource (or non-RDF
          Resource) associated with a particular resource. When a client POSTs an attachment content to a server, the
          server stores the attachment content and assigns a URI just like any other type of resource creation but it
          may also create an <code>oslc:AttachmentDescriptor</code> resource to contain data about the attachment.
        </p>

        <p>
          There is no restriction on the content of each attachment resource. For example, it could be a photo of a
          kitten, an installation manual, a log file, or a source code patch. Since the attachment cannot be expected to
          contain additional client or server supplied data, a typical set of properties for each attachment is included
          with the <code>oslc:AttachmentDescriptor</code> resource itself. Thus, the object of each
          <code>oslc:attachment</code> statement is the binary attachment. Issuing an HTTP HEAD or GET operation on that
          binary attachment resource URL should produce an HTTP response with a header value of
          <code>Link: rel='describedBy'</code> to indicate the URL of the
          <code>oslc:AttachmentDescriptor</code> resource. The properties for the
          <code>oslc:AttachmentDescriptor</code> resource are indicated in the table below.
        </p>
