      Core Vocabulary defines the OSLC Core RDF vocabulary terms and resources, that have broad applicability across
      various domains. This document specifies the standard constraints on those vocabulary terms using OSLC
      ResourceShapes.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        RDF vocabularies define the terms and resources for a domain of interest, life-cycle management in the case of
        OSLC Core. These vocabularies are often specified in an open manner, without providing information such as
        property domain and range assertions, cardinalities, etc. This helps keep the vocabulary applicable for a wide
        range of uses and furthering integration with other vocabularies.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, it is often desirable to closed down a vocabulary with specific constraints to facilitate using the
        vocabulary for a specific purpose. This document specifies the constraints for using the OSLC Core vocabulary in
        OSLC. Different sets of constraints may be applied to a vocabulary in order to tailor its use, without overly
        constraining the vocabulary for other usages.
      </p>

      <p>
        These constraints apply to the core vocabulary defined in
        <a href="core-vocab.html">OSLC Core Version 3.0. Part 7: Vocabulary</a>.

      <h2>Resource Shape</h2>
      <p>
        The shape of an RDF resource is a description of the set of triples it is expected to contain and the integrity
        constraints those triples are required to satisfy. Applications of shapes include validating RDF data,
        documenting RDF APIs, and providing meta-data to tools, such as form and query builders, that handle RDF data.
        OSLC Core uses shapes to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Define specific vocabulary constraints including allowed values, max size, cardinality, representation in RDF
          specifications and if the property is read only.
        </li>
        <li>Specify the properties required for resource creation.</li>
        <li>Specify what servers all allow for prefilling delegated dialogs.</li>
        <li>Describe the results of query operations.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Constraints on OSLC Core and Domain resources SHOULD be described using
        <a href="./resource-shape.html">ResourceShapes</a> which is included as part of the OSLC Core multi-part
        specifications. Servers MAY use other constraint languages such as [[SHACL]] to define resource constraints.

    <section id="commonprops">
      <h2>Common Properties</h2>
      <p>
        Unlike the rest of the Core specification, these properties change and grow as new common properties are added.
        The properties that we list here are available for use in OSLC domain specifications when defining OSLC
        resources, but this does not mean that they are required to be in OSLC resources. OSLC domain specifications
        decide which properties are allowed and required for resources needed to realize their use cases. The OSLC
        common properties include properties defined in other standard vocabularies including:

          It is common to collect a series of comments on a lifecycle resource, often referred to as a discussion. For
          example: tasks, bug reports, requirements, assets and so on, are often collected across various types of
          resources such as project. A project might reflect the planning of work to deliver a product that realizes the
          requirements as validated through test cases and bug reports. Discussions allow users to collaborate with each
          other for more efficient and effective delivery. This Discussion resource definition provides a minimal shape
          describing the needed properties.
