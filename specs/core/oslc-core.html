      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        Information Technology (IT) enterprises are constantly addressing demands to do more with less. To meet this
        demand they need more efficient development processes and supporting tools. This has resulted in demand for
        better support of integrated system and software processes. Enterprises want solutions (such as software or
        hardware development tools) from different vendors, open source projects and their own proprietary components to
        work together. This level of integration, however, can become quite challenging and unmanageable. In order to
        enable integration between a heterogeneous set of tools and components from various sources, there is a need for
        a sufficient supporting architecture that is loosely coupled, minimal, and standardized. OSLC is based on World
        Wide Web and Linked Data principles, such as those defined in the W3C Linked Data Platform [[!LDP]], to create a
        cohesive set of specifications that can enable products, services, and other distributed network resources to
        interoperate successfully [[!LDP]].
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src="images/oslc-architecture.png" />
        <figcaption>OSLC Core 3.0 Architecture</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        OSLC is motivated by domain-driven scenarios that inspire standardization of common capabilities across
        disciplines such as change management, requirements management, and quality management, as well as by
        cross-domain scenarios such as Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) &amp; DevOps, Product Lifecycle Management
        (PLM), and Integrated Service Management (ISM). The OSLC approach focuses on software lifecycle management to
        ensure it meets a core set of scenarios and requirements. Nonetheless, it can be used by tools belonging to any
        other domains and cross-domain scenarios such as Internet of Things, back office application integration, and
        customer relationship management.
      </p>

      <p>
        The OSLC Core specifications provide additional capabilities that expand on the W3C LDP capabilities, as needed,
        to enable key integration scenarios. These capabilities define the essential and common technical elements of
        OSLC domain specifications and offer guidance on common concerns for creating, updating, retrieving, and linking
        to lifecycle resources based on W3C [[!LDP]].
      </p>

        <img src="images/oslc-overview.png" />
        <figcaption>OSLC Core 3.0 Overview</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        As seen in <a href="#fig-oslc-core-3.0-overview"></a>, there are a number of capabilities developed in different
        standards organizations and working groups. The arrows represent either dependencies or extensions to some
        specifications or capabilities. OSLC domain specifications may depend on OSLC Core 3.0 specifications as
        scenarios motivate. However, a leading goal is to minimize and eliminate unnecessary dependencies to simplify
        adoption, which may result in no dependency on OSLC Core 3.0 specifications for some OSLC domains.
      </p>

      <p>
        This work is an evolution from the OSLC Core 2.0 [[!OSLCCore2]] efforts, taking the experience gained from that
        effort along with the common foundation on W3C LDP, to produce an updated set of specifications that are
        simpler, built on layered capabilities and easier to adopt.

        The primary goal of OSLC is to enable integration of federated, shared information across tools that support
        different, but related domains. OSLC was initially focused on development of Information Technology (IT)
        solutions involving processes, activities, work products and supporting tools for Application Lifecycle
        Management (ALM). However, OSLC capabilities could be applicable to other domains. The specific goals for OSLC
        Core 3.0 are to build on the existing OSLC Core 2.0 specifications to further facilitate the development and
        integration of domains and supporting tools that address additional integration needs. Specifically:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Integration is based on an open standard, and not controlled by any single vendor</li>
        <li>
          OSLC 3.0 is based on the new W3C Linked Data Platform standard which provides a solid foundation for reading
          and writing linked data resources
        </li>
        <li>
          The specifications are simpler, more consistent and will potentially be more attractive to, and easier to
          consume by new integrations
        </li>
        <li>
          There are some new capabilities including Attachments, inverse link labels, traceability and impact types
        </li>
        <li>Domain vocabularies can be improved for data consistency and removing data gaps</li>
        <li>All Resource Shapes are provided in machine readable [[Turtle]] files</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The following guiding principles were used to govern the evolution of OSLC and guide the development of the OSLC
        Core 3.0 specifications.
      </p>

      <em class="loc-heading">Scenario-driven</em>
      <p>
        Every capability should be linked back to key integration scenarios that motivate its need. These are important
        not only for knowing that the correct specification content is being developed but also to assist with
        implementers understanding the intended usage and in developing relevant test cases.
      </p>

      <em class="loc-heading">Incremental</em>
      <p>
        Specifications should be developed in an incremental fashion that not only validates the technical approaches
        but also delivers integration value sooner.
      </p>

      <em class="loc-heading">Loose-coupling</em>
      <p>
        Specifications should support a model where clients have little to no knowledge about server
        implementation-specific behaviors in order to support key integration scenarios. As a result, clients should be
        unaffected by any server application software or data model implementation changes. Similarly, client software
        should be able to be independently changed without changes to server software.
      </p>

      <em class="loc-heading">Minimalistic</em>
      <p>
        Specification authors should strive to find not only the simplest solution that would work for a given scenario
        but allows for easy adoption. Authors should avoid solutions that offer additional capabilities which may
        inhibit adoption of necessary capabilities.
      </p>

      <em class="loc-heading">Capability Based</em>
      <p>
        A capability is the ability to perform actions to achieve outcomes described by scenarios through the use of
        specific technologies. Capabilities should be incrementally defined as independent focused specifications and
        independently discoverable at runtime. Even though there may be some generally agreed upon best practices for
        capability publication and discovery, each capability should define how it is published and discovered. The Core
        OSLC capabilities are defined in this specification.
      </p>

      <em class="loc-heading">Vocabularies</em>
      <p>
        Various OSLC MS-affiliated TCs, or any specification development body that is authoring specifications for
        specific domains of knowledge, should minimally define vocabularies and the semantics behind the various terms.
        Some consideration should be given for global reuse when terms are used for cross domain queries and within
        other domain resource shape definitions. Domain specifications are the definition of an OSLC capability, and how
        those vocabulary terms are used in LDP interactions by both the clients and servers of that capability. The
        specification should include defining resource shapes that describe resources based on a set of vocabulary
        terms, which introduces any domain specific constraints on the vocabulary's usage.
      </p>

      <p>
        OSLC domain vocabularies should follow the recommended best practices for managing RDF vocabularies described at
        [[LDBestPractices]].
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Architecture</h2>
      <p>
        In support of the previously stated goals and motivation, it is desired to have a consistent and recommended
        architecture. The architecture needs to support scenarios requiring a protocol to access, create, update and
        delete resources. [[!LDP]] is the foundation for this protocol. Resources need to relate, or link, to one
        another utilizing a consistent, standard and web-scale data model. Resource Description Framework (RDF)
        [[rdf11-concepts]] is the foundation for this. The ability to work with these data models over HTTP protocols,
        is based on [[!LDP]].
      </p>

      <p>
        Some scenarios require the need to integrate user interface components: either within a desktop or mobile
        web-browser, mobile device application, or rich desktop applications. For these scenarios the technology is
        rapidly evolving and changing. Priority should be based on existing standards such as HTML5, with use of
        <code>iframe</code> and <code>postMessage()</code>. [[HTML5]]
      </p>

      <p>
        OSLC Core specification documents elaborate on the conformance requirements leveraging these various
        technologies and approaches.
      </p>

      <p>
        As the primary goals have been outlined around lifecycle integration, some scenarios may require exploration of
        new (or different) approaches and technologies. As with all specification development efforts, the OSLC Open
        Project will advise, develop and approve such efforts.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h2>OSLC Core 3.0 Capabilities</h2>
      <p>
        The following sections and referenced documents define the capabilities for OSLC Core 3.0. These documents
        comprise the multi-part specification for OSLC Core 3.0. They represent common capabilities that servers may
        provide and that may be discovered and used by clients. Although OSLC Core could be useful on its own, it is
        intended to specify capabilities that are common across many domains. Servers will generally specify conformance
        with specific domain specifications, and those domain specifications will describe what parts of OSLC Core are
        required for conformance. This allows servers to implement the capabilities they need in a standard way without
        the burden of implementing capabilities that are not required. The purpose of the OSLC Core Discovery capability
        is to allow clients to determine what capabilities are provided by a server. Any provided capability must meet
        all the conformance criteria for that capability as defined in the OSLC Core 3.0 specifications.
      </p>

      <p>
        This implies that any capability that is discoverable is essentially optional, and once discovered, the
        capability is provided as defined in the applicable OSLC specifications. Servers should support OSLC Discovery,
        but Discovery itself is also an optional capability as servers could provide other means of informing specific
        clients of supported OSLC capabilities that could be utilized directly. For example, a server might provide only
        preview dialogs on specific resources and nothing else.

      <section id="resourceShapes">
        <h2>Resource Constraints</h2>
        <p>
          The shape of an RDF resource is a description of the set of triples it is expected to contain and the
          integrity constraints those triples are required to satisfy. Applications of shapes include validating RDF
          data, documenting RDF APIs, and providing metadata to tools that handle RDF data such as form and query
          builders.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shapes are different than vocabularies in that shapes may change with new revisions of resource definitions,
          whereas vocabularies should evolve in place in a compatible manner.
        </p>
        <p class="conformance">
          Constraints on OSLC Core and Domain resources SHOULD be described using
          <a href="resource-shape.html">OSLC Core Version 3.0. Part 6: Resource Shape</a> which is included as part of
          the OSLC Core multi-part specifications. Servers MAY use other constraint languages such as [[SHACL]] to
          define resource constraints.
        </p>
        <p class="conformance">
          OSLC Domain specifications SHOULD use the following URI pattern when publishing each individual resource
          shape:

          <pre>
        http://open-services.net/ns/[vocab short name]/shapes/[version]/[shape-name]

          >

          <p>
            For example, for Change Management 3.0, a shape describing the base Change Request resource type might have
            the shape URI:
          </p>
          <pre>
        http://open-services.net/ns/cm/shapes/3.0/changerequest

          <div class="conformance">
            <p>
              To allow different versions of individual shapes to be reused in different versions of a domain
              specification while still allowing a client to browse the set of possible shapes, domains SHOULD provide
              an LDPC for all the shapes for a spec version, at a URI defined by the following pattern:
            </p>
            <pre>

          <p>
            OSLC domain specifications specify the representations needed for the specific scenarios that they are
            addressing, and should recognize that different representations are appropriate for different purposes. For
            example, browser oriented scenarios might be best addressed by JSON or Atom format representations.
          </p>

          <p>
            OSLC domain specifications are also expected to follow common practices and conventions that are in concert
            with existing industry standards and which offer consistency across domains. All of the OSLC specifications
            are built upon the standard RDF data model, allowing OSLC to align with the Linked-Data Platform [[!LDP]].
            In addition, all OSLC specifications have adopted the convention to illustrate most examples using Turtle
            and/or JSON-LD representations and will typically require these representations to enable consistency across
            OSLC implementations.

          <p>
            By adding the key=value pair <code>oslc.properties</code>, specified below, to a resource URI, a client can
            request a new resource with a subset of the original resource's values. An additional key=value pair
            <code>oslc.prefix</code> can be used to define prefixes used to identify the selected properties.
          </p>

          <p>
            The <code>oslc.properties</code> key=value pair lets you specify the set of properties to be included in the
            response. Both immediate and nested properties may be specified. A nested property is a property that
            belongs to the resource referenced by another property. Nested properties are enclosed in brace brackets,
            and this nesting may be done recursively, i.e. a nested property may contain other nested properties.

            Suppose this bug resource has properties such as <code>dcterms:title</code>,

            <code>dcterms:creator</code> refers to a person resource that has properties such as
            <code>foaf:givenName</code> and <code>foaf:familyName</code>. Suppose you want a representation of the bug
            report that includes its <code>dcterms:title</code> and the <code>foaf:givenName</code> and
            <code>foaf:familyName</code> of the person referred to by its <code>dcterms:creator</code>. The following
            URL illustrates the use of the <code>oslc.properties</code> query value to include those properties:

          <p>
            In our examples of <code>oslc.properties</code>, property names include a URI prefix, i.e. dcterms: or
            foaf:. Here we assume that OSLC has predefined the Dublin Core ( dcterms:) and Friend of a Friend ( foaf:)
            prefixes. However, OSLC resources should also be open to new content, which means that new properties may
            not have predefined URI prefixes. We therefore need a way to define new URI prefixes in resource requests.
            The oslc.prefix value lets you specify URI prefixes used in property names. For example, suppose the foaf:
            prefix was not predefined. The following URL illustrates the use of the oslc.prefix value to define it:

          <p>
            Resource Preview specifies a technique to get a minimal HTML representation of a resource identified by a
            URL. Applications often use this representation to display a link with an appropriate icon, a label, or
            display a small or large preview when a user makes some gesture over a link.

          <h2>Query</h2>
          <p>
            OSLC servers will often manage large amounts of potentially complex link-data entities. Practical use of
            this information will require some query capability that minimally supports selection of matching elements,
            filtering of desired properties and ordering. OSLC Core defines a query capability that is relatively
            simple, can be implemented on a wide range of existing server architectures, and provides a standard, data
            source independent query mechanism. The purpose of this query capability is to support tool integration
            through a common query mechanism.
          </p>
          <p class="conformance">
            OSLC Servers MAY support a <em>Query Capability</em> as defined in
            <a href="../query/oslc-query.html">OSLC Query Version 3.0</a> to enable clients to perform selection and
            projection operations in order to retrieve a selected subset of resources and property values from an LDPC.

        <section id="resourcePaging">
          <h2>Resource Paging</h2>
          <p>
            When a client requests a resource, the client should expect that the entire resource will be returned in the
            response, with all property values. This can be problematic because, in some cases, resources may be so
            large that a client might not want to retrieve the entire resource in one HTTP response.
          </p>

          <p>
            One solution for clients that are sensitive to response size is to check the response size before loading.
            This method is described in the next section. Another solution is to use Resource Paging.
          </p>

          <p>
            Resource Paging specifies a capability for servers to make the state of large resources or long lists of
            resources available as a list of smaller subset resources (pages) whose representation is easier to produce
            by the server and consume by clients. Resource paging is particularly useful in handling results from the
            query capability or the contents of an LDP container.
          </p>

          <section id="checkingResponseSize">
            <h2>Checking Response Size</h2>

            <p>
              Clients that do not wish to load large resources may use the HTTP HEAD method to determine the size of a
              resource.
            </p>
            <p class="conformance">
              When responding to an HTTP HEAD request, according to [[!HTTP11]] the server SHOULD include an HTTP
              Content-Length header that indicates the size of the resource as the "decimal number of octets."

            <h3>Paging Stability</h3>

            <p>
              Because HTTP is a stateless protocol and OSLC Services manage resources that can change frequently, OSLC
              clients should assume that the resources returned on a given page are unstable and may change over time.
            </p>

            <p>
              Some OSLC Servers might wish to guarantee stable paging, meaning that the sequence of pages returned from
              the server represent a snapshot in time and will not change as the client pages through them. OSLC
              specifications that require stable paging should state this requirement and specify to which resources it
              applies.
            </p>

            <p>
              Note that because stable paging implementations are based on server-side state, it is possible that the
              state will expire.

            <p>
              A response info resource representation describes information about a paged HTTP response body in which it

              be included in each page. Servers MAY return pages containing more or fewer RDF statements than specified.

              the server break each response into pages using the specified value as a hint for maximum number of RDF
              statements in each page. Clients should make no assumptions about the maximum number of RDF statements

        <p>
          OSLC is intended to provide a foundation for (lifecycle) application interoperability. A significant number of
          OSLC domains, and client and server implementations already exist and are in common use. Interoperability
          issues between applications on incompatible OSLC versions could result in negative impact to end users. One of
          the goals of the OSLC initiative is to mitigate or eliminate the need for lock-step version upgrades, where
          clients or servers target one version of a specification and break when new versions are introduced --
          requiring all services to be upgraded simultaneously.
        </p>

        <p>
          OSLC Core and domain specifications will each be versioned independently, and may specify version numbers.
          Existing OSLC 2.0 clients and servers use the OSLC-Core-Version header described in
          <a href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OslcCoreSpecification#Specification_Versioning"
            >OSLC Core 2.0 Specification Versioning</a
          >
          to indicate what OSLC version they expect or support. But exposing version numbers in OSLC implementations
          could lead to interoperability issues. Ultimately each domain will decide its compatibility needs. OSLC Core
          3.0 does not introduce any changes that would break existing OSLC 2.0 clients. Because of this, there is no
          need for OSLC Core 3.0 to require servers or clients to utilize an OSLC-Core-Version header with a value of
          3.0.
        </p>

        <p>
          If an OSLC 2.0 client accesses an OSLC 3.0 server, the 3.0 server will always respond to the client in a
          manner that is compatible with 2.0. The response may include additional headers and entity request or response
          body information defined by OSLC Core 3.0, but this information will be simply ignored by the 2.0 clients.
          There will be no missing or invalid information since OSLC Core 3.0 is designed to be compatible with OSLC
          Core 2.0.
        </p>

        <p>For OSLC clients that access 2.0 servers:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            OSLC 1.0 clients - get 1.0 responses by default from 2.0 servers and don't interoperate with 3.0 servers.
          </li>
          <li>
            OSLC 2.0 clients - interact with 2.0 servers that may or may not implement 1.0 by using the
            OSLC-Core-Version header.
          </li>
          <li>
            OSLC 3.0 Clients - if they are accessing 2.0 servers that might return 1.0 responses without the header,
            then they would have to provide the header as specified in
            <a href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OslcCoreSpecification#Specification_Versioning"
              >OSLC Core 2.0 Specification Versioning</a
            >,
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          OSLC Core 3.0 does not address compatibility with versions of OSLC prior to [[!OSLCCore2]]. Servers wishing to
          support compatibility with versions prior to 2.0 should follow
