    <p>Defines the overall approach to Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC) based specifications and capabilities that extend and complement W3C Linked Data Platform
    [[!LDP]]. OSLC Core 3.0 constitutes the approach outlined in this document

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Information Technology (IT) enterprises are constantly addressing demands
to do more with less. To meet this demand they need more efficient development
processes and supporting tools. This has resulted in demand for better
support of integrated system and software processes. Enterprises want
solutions (such as software or hardware development tools) from different
vendors, open source projects and their own proprietary components to work
together. This level of integration, however, can become quite challenging and
unmanageable. In order to enable integration between a heterogeneous set of
tools and components from various sources, there is a need for a sufficient
supporting architecture that is loosely coupled, minimal, and
standardized. OSLC is based on World Wide Web and Linked Data principles, such
as those defined in the W3C Linked Data Platform [[!LDP]], to create a cohesive
set of specifications that can enable products, services, and other
distributed network resources to interoperate successfully [[!LDP]].</p>

<figure>

  <figcaption>OSLC Core 3.0 Architecture</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>OSLC is motivated by domain-driven scenarios that inspire standardization
of common capabilities across disciplines such as change management,
requirements management, and quality management, as well as by cross-domain
scenarios such as Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) &amp; DevOps, Product
Lifecycle Management (PLM), and Integrated Service Management (ISM). The OSLC approach focuses on software lifecycle management to ensure it meets a core set of scenarios and requirements. Nonetheless, it can be used by tools belonging to any other domains and cross-domain scenarios such as Internet of Things, back office application integration, and customer relationship management.</p>

<p>The OSLC Core specifications provide additional capabilities that expand on
the W3C LDP capabilities, as needed, to enable key integration scenarios. These capabilities define the essential and common technical elements of OSLC domain specifications and offers guidance on common concerns for creating, updating, retrieving, and linking to lifecycle resources based on W3C [[!LDP]]. These specifications have emerged from the best practices and other work of other OSLC Member Section (MS)-affiliated Technical Committees (TCs), sometime referred to as OSLC domain TCs.  OSLC domain TCs focus on a certain domain or topic. The <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/oslc-core/">OSLC Core TC</a> develops technical specifications, creates best practices documents and formulates design principles that can be leveraged by other OSLC MS-affiliated TCs to enable them to focus on domain-specific concerns.</p>

  <figcaption>OSLC Core 3.0 Overview</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As seen in <a href="#fig-oslc-core-3.0-overview"></a>, there are a number
of capabilities developed in different standards organizations, TCs and
working groups.  The arrows represent either dependencies or extensions to
some specifications or capabilities.  OSLC MS-affiliated TC developed
specifications may depend on OSLC Core 3.0 specifications as scenarios
motivate. However, a leading goal is to minimize and eliminate unnecessary
dependencies to simplify adoption, which may result in no dependency on OSLC
Core 3.0 specifications for some OSLC domains.</p>

<p>This work is an evolution from the OSLC Core 2.0 [[!OSLCCore2]] efforts,
taking the experience gained from that effort along with the common
foundation on W3C LDP, to produce an updated set of specifications that are
simpler, built on layered capabilities and easier to adopt.</p>

  <section id='motivation' class='informative'>
    <h2>Goals/Motivation</h2>
    <p>The primary goal of OSLC is to enable integration of federated, shared information across tools that support different, but related domains. OSLC was initially focused on development of Information Technology (IT) solutions involving processes, activities, work products and supporting tools for Application Lifecycle Management (ALM). However, OSLC capabilities could be applicable to other domains. The specific goals for OSLC Core 3.0 are to build on the existing OSLC Core 2.0 specifications to further facilitate the development and integration of domains and supporting tools that address additional integration needs. Specifically:
    <ul>
      <li>Integration is based on an open standard, and not controlled by any single vendor</li>
      <li>OSLC 3.0 is based on the new W3C Linked Data Platform standard which provides a solid foundation for reading and writing linked data resources</li>
      <li>The specifications are simpler, more consistent and will potentially be more attractive to, and easier to consume by new integrations</li>
      <li>There are some new capabilities including Attachments, inverse link labels, traceability and impact types</li>
      <li>Domain vocabularies can be improved for data consistency and removing data gaps</li>
      <li>All Resource Shapes are provided in machine readable [[Turtle]] files</li>
    </ul></p>
    <p>The following guiding principles were used to govern the evolution of OSLC and guide the development of the OSLC Core 3.0 specifications.</p>

    <em class='loc-heading'>Scenario-driven</em>
    <p>Every capability should be linked back to
      key integration scenarios that motivate its need. These are important not only for knowing that the correct specification content is being developed but also to assist with implementers understanding the intended usage and in developing relevant test cases.</p>

    <em class='loc-heading'>Incremental</em>
    <p>Specifications should be developed in an incremental fashion
      that not only validates the technical approaches but also delivers
      integration value sooner.</p>

    <em class='loc-heading'>Loose-coupling</em>
    <p>Specifications should support a model where clients have little
      to no knowledge about server implementation-specific behaviors in
      order to support key integration scenarios. As a result, clients
      should be unaffected by any server application software
      or data model implementation changes. Similarly, client software should be able to be independently changed without changes to server software.</p>

    <em class='loc-heading'>Minimalistic</em>
    <p>Specification authors should strive to find not only the
      simplest solution that would work for a given scenario but allows for easy adoption. Authors should avoid solutions that offer additional capabilities which may inhibit adoption of necessary capabilities.</p>

    <em class='loc-heading'>Capability Based</em>
    <p>A capability is the ability to perform actions to achieve outcomes described by scenarios through the use of specific technologies. Capabilities should be incrementally defined as independent focused specifications and independently discoverable at runtime. Even though there may be some generally agreed upon best practices for capability publication and discovery, each capability should define how it is published and discovered. The Core OSLC capabilities are defined in this specification.</p>

    <em class='loc-heading'>Vocabularies</em>
    <p>Various OSLC MS-affiliated TCs, or any specification development body that is authoring specifications for specific domains of knowledge, should minimally define vocabularies and the semantics behind the various terms.  Some consideration should be given for global reuse when terms are used for cross domain queries and within
    other domain resource shape definitions. Domain specifications are
    the definition of an OSLC capability, and how those vocabulary terms are used in LDP interactions by both the clients and servers of that capability. The specification should include defining resource shapes that describe resources based on a set of vocabulary terms, which introduces any domain specific constraints on the vocabulary's usage.
    </p>

    <p>OSLC domain vocabularies should follow the recommended best practices for managing RDF vocabularies described at [[LDBestPractices]].</p>

    <h2>Architecture</h2>
    <p>In support of the previously stated goals and motivation, it is desired to have a consistent and recommended architecture. The architecture needs to support scenarios requiring a protocol to access, create, update and delete resources. [[!LDP]] is the foundation for this protocol. Resources need to relate, or link, to one another utilizing a consistent, standard and web-scale data model. Resource Description Framework (RDF) [[rdf11-concepts]] is the foundation for this. The ability to work with these data models over HTTP protocols, is based on [[!LDP]].  </p>

    <p>Some scenarios require the need to integrate user interface components: either within a desktop or mobile web-browser, mobile device application, or rich desktop applications.  For these scenarios the technology is rapidly evolving and changing.  Priority should be based on existing standards such as HTML5, with use of <code>iframe</code> and <code>postMessage()</code>. [[HTML5]]</p>

    <p>OSLC Core specification documents elaborate on the conformance requirements leveraging these various technologies and
    approaches.</p>

    <p>As the primary goals have been outlined around lifecycle integration, some scenarios may require exploration of new (or different) approaches and technologies.  As with all specification development efforts, the OSLC Core TC will advise, develop and approve
    such efforts through the established processes for cross-TC and organization coordination.</p>
  </section>

  <section class='informative'>
    <h2>OSLC Core 3.0 Capabilities</h2>
    <p>The following sections and referenced documents define the capabilities for OSLC Core 3.0. These documents comprise the multi-part specification for OSLC Core 3.0. They represent common capabilities that servers may provide and that may be discovered and used by clients. Although OSLC Core could be useful on its own, it is intended to specify capabilities that are common across many domains. Servers will generally specify conformance with specific domain specifications, and those domain specifications will describe what parts of OSLC Core are required for conformance. This allows servers to implement the capabilities they need in a standard way without the burden of implementing capabilities that are not required. The purpose of the OSLC Core Discovery capability is to allow clients to determine what capabilities are provided by a server. Any provided capability must meet all the conformance criteria for that capability as defined in the OSLC Core 3.0 specifications.</p>

    <p>This implies that any capability that is discoverable is essentially optional, and once discovered, the capability is provided as defined in the applicable OSLC specifications. Servers should support OSLC Discovery, but Discovery itself is also an optional capability as servers could provide other means of informing specific clients of supported OSLC capabilities that could be utilized directly. For example, a server might provide only preview dialogs on specific resources and nothing else.</p>

  <section id='resourceShapes'>
    <h2>Resource Constraints</h2>
    <p>The shape of an RDF resource is a description of the set of triples it is expected to contain and the integrity constraints those triples are required to satisfy. Applications of shapes include validating RDF data, documenting RDF APIs, and providing metadata to tools that handle RDF data such as form and query builders.</p>
    <p>
    Shapes are different than vocabularies in that shapes may change with new revisions of resource definitions, whereas vocabularies should evolve in place in a compatible manner.</p>
    <p class='conformance'>Constraints on OSLC Core and Domain resources SHOULD be described using [[!OSLCShapes]] which is included as part of the OSLC Core multi-part specifications. Servers MAY use other constraint languages such as [[SHACL]] to define resource constraints.
    </p>
    <div class='conformance'>
    <p>OSLC Domain specifications SHOULD use the following URI pattern when publishing each individual resource shape:
    </p>
    <section id='URIPattern'>
    <pre>
        http://open-services.net/ns/[vocab short name]/shapes/[version]/[shape-name]
    </pre>
    </div>
    <p>For example, for Change Management 3.0, a shape describing the base Change Request resource type might have the shape URI:</p>
      <pre>
        http://open-services.net/ns/cm/shapes/3.0/changerequest
      </pre>
    <p>Not all shapes would necessarily be updated at the same time. </p>
    <div class='conformance'>
    <p>
      To allow different versions of individual shapes to be reused in different versions of a domain specification while still allowing a client to browse the set of possible shapes, domains SHOULD provide an LDPC for all the shapes for a spec version, at a URI defined by the following pattern:</p>
    <pre>
      http://open-services.net/ns/[vocab short name]/shapes/[SPEC-version]
    </pre>
    </div>
    <p>For example, for Change Management 3.0, there should be a container at: <code>http://open-services.net/ns/cm/shapes/3.0</code> with members such as:</p>
    <pre>
        http://open-services.net/ns/cm/shapes/3.0/changerequest
        http://open-services.net/ns/cm/shapes/3.0/somenewshape

    <section id="resourceRepresentations">
      <h2>Resource Representations</h2>
      <p> OSLC resource representations come in many forms and are subject to standard HTTP and mechanisms for content negotiation.</p>

      <p>OSLC domain specifications specify the representations needed for the specific scenarios that they are addressing, and should recognize that different representations are appropriate for different purposes. For example, browser oriented scenarios might be best addressed by JSON or Atom format representations.</p>

      <p>OSLC domain specifications are also expected to follow common practices and conventions that are in concert with existing industry standards and which offer consistency across domains. All of the OSLC specifications are built upon the standard RDF data model, allowing OSLC to align with the Linked-Data Platform [[!LDP]]. In addition, all OSLC specifications have adopted the convention to illustrate most examples using Turtle and/or JSON-LD representations and will typically require these representations to enable consistency across OSLC implementations. </p>

      <p class='conformance'>
        OSLC Services MUST support at least one RDF resource serialization format, and SHOULD support as many serialization formats as possible through content negotiation.</p>

      <p class='conformance'>
        OSLC Services SHOULD provide and accept RDF documents in Turtle format (identified by the MIME-type 'text/turtle') and in JSON-LD format (identified by the MIME-type 'application/ld+json') representations for each OSLC resource for compatibility with LDP 1.0.</p>

      <p class='conformance'>
        OSLC Services SHOULD provide and accept RDF/XML representations for each OSLC resource to preserve compatibility with [[OSLCCore2]].</p>

    <section id="resourceOperations">
      <h2>Resource Operations</h2>
      <p>Resource Operations specify how clients create, read, update and delete resources managed by servers.</p>

      <p>OSLC Core defines a set of HTTP REST services for a set of capabilities that facilitate flexible, loosely coupled tool integration. These services may be augmented by varous OSLC domain specifications that specify the capabilities, vocabularies and constraints that define specific resources managed by these integration capabilities.</p>

      <p class='conformance'>OSLC Servers MUST implement standard HTTP protocols and MUST at least support <code>GET</code> requests that respond with resources in some RDF serialization format.</p>

      <p class="conformance">
        OSLC Services use HTTP for create, retrieve, update and delete operations on resources. OSLC Services MUST comply with the HTTP specification [[!HTTP11]].
      </p>
      <p class="conformance">
        Because the update process may involve first getting a resource, modifying it and then later putting it back to the server, there is the possibility of a conflict, e.g. some other client may have have updated the resource since the GET. To mitigate this problem, OSLC Services SHOULD use the HTTP <code>If-Match</code> header on a PUT request:</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="conformance">If the HTTP <code>If-Match</code> header is missing OSLC Services SHOULD return HTTP Bad Request (400) status code to indicate that the header is required.</li>
          <li class="conformance">If the HTTP <code>If-Match</code> header is present OSLC Services MUST behave as described in the HTTP specification, returning an HTTP Precondition Failed (412) error to indicate that the header does not match.</li>
          <li class="conformance">If the HTTP <code>If-Match</code> header is present and it matches, but there is some other problem or conflict with the update then OSLC Services MAY return an HTTP Conflict (409) to indicate that problem.</li>
        </ul>

      <p class="conformance">An OSLC Service SHOULD preserve property values that are not part of the resource definition or Resource Shape known by the server (unknown property values). An OSLC Service MUST return a 4xx status code if it decides not to persist any of the unknown property values (in accordance with the LDP specification §4.2.4.4).</p>

      <p class="conformance">An OSLC Client MUST preserve any unknown property values between requests to the OSLC Services for all HTTP verbs except PATCH (in accordance with the LDP specification §4.3.1.11).</p>
    </section>

    <section id="selectiveProperties"><h2>Selective Properties</h2>
      <p class='conformance'>OSLC Services MAY support a technique called Selective Properties to enable clients to retrieve only selected property values.</p>

      <p>By adding the key=value pair <code>oslc.properties</code>, specified below, to a resource URI, a client can request a new resource with a subset of the original resource's values. An additional key=value pair <code>oslc.prefix</code> can be used to define prefixes used to identify the selected properties.</p>

      <p>The <code>oslc.properties</code> key=value pair lets you specify the set of properties to be included in the response. Both immediate and nested properties may be specified. A nested property is a property that belongs to the resource referenced by another property. Nested properties are enclosed in brace brackets, and this nesting may be done recursively, i.e. a nested property may contain other nested properties.</p>

      <p>For example, suppose we have a bug report resource at the following URL:</p>
      <pre class="example" title="Bug Report URL">
http://example.com/bugs/4242
      </pre>
      <p>Suppose this bug resource has properties such as <code>dcterms:title</code>, <code>dcterms:description</code>, and <code>dcterms:creator</code>, and that <code>dcterms:creator</code> refers to a person resource that has properties such as <code>foaf:givenName</code> and <code>foaf:familyName</code>. Suppose you want a representation of the bug report that includes its <code>dcterms:title</code> and the <code>foaf:givenName</code> and <code>foaf:familyName</code> of the person referred to by its <code>dcterms:creator</code>. The following URL illustrates the use of the <code>oslc.properties</code> query value to include those properties:</p>
      <pre class="example" title="Selective Properties URL">
http://example.com/bugs/4242?oslc.properties=dcterms:title,dcterms:creator{foaf:givenName,foaf:familyName}
      </pre>
      <p>The <code>oslc.properties</code> pair is defined by the oslc_properties term in the following BNF grammar:</p>
      <pre>
oslc_properties ::= "oslc.properties=" properties
properties      ::= property ("," property)*
property        ::= identifier | wildcard | nested_prop
nested_prop     ::= (identifier | wildcard) "{" properties "}"
wildcard        ::= "*"
identifier      ::= PrefixedName
PrefixedName    ::= /* see "SPARQL Query Language for RDF", http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/#rPrefixedName */      </pre>
      <p>In our examples of <code>oslc.properties</code>, property names include a URI prefix, i.e. dcterms: or foaf:. Here we assume that OSLC has predefined the Dublin Core ( dcterms:) and Friend of a Friend ( foaf:) prefixes. However, OSLC resources should also be open to new content, which means that new properties may not have predefined URI prefixes. We therefore need a way to define new URI prefixes in resource requests. The oslc.prefix value lets you specify URI prefixes used in property names. For example, suppose the foaf: prefix was not predefined. The following URL illustrates the use of the oslc.prefix value to define it:</p>
<pre class="example" title="Example URL with oslc.prefix">
http://example.com/bugs/4242?oslc.prefix=foaf=&lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/&gt;&amp;oslc.properties=foaf:lastName,...
</pre>

      <p>The syntax of the <code>oslc.prefix</code> is defined by the oslc_prefix term in the following BNF grammar:</p>
<pre>
oslc_prefix ::= "oslc.prefix=" prefix_defs
prefix_defs ::= prefix_def ("," prefix_def)*
prefix_def  ::= prefix "=" uri_ref_esc
prefix      ::= PN_PREFIX
PN_PREFIX   ::= /* see "SPARQL Query Language for RDF", http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/#rPN_PREFIX */
uri_ref_esc ::= /* an angle bracket-delimited URI reference in which > and \ are \-escaped. */
</pre>

      <p>OSLC Core specifies a number of predefined PrefixDefinitions for convenience. OSLC Domain specifications may specify additional pre-defined PrefixDefinitions for their purposes.</p>
    <p>An OSLC Server SHOULD support the following PrefixDefinitions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>dcterms: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/terms/&gt;</li>

    <section id="query">
      <h2>Query</h2>
      <p>
        OSLC servers will often manage large amounts of potentially complex link-data entities. Practical use of this information will require some query capability that minimally supports selection of matching elements, filtering of desired properties and ordering. OSLC Core defines a query capability that is relatively simple, can be implemented on a wide range of existing server architectures, and provides a standard, data source independent query mechanism. The purpose of this query capability is to support tool integration through a common query mechanism.</p>
      <p class='conformance'>
        OSLC Servers MAY support a <em>Query Capability</em> as defined in [[!OSLCQuery3]] to enable clients to perform selection and projection operations in order to retrieve a selected subset of resources and property values from an LDPC.

    </section>

    <section id="resourcePaging">
      <h2>Resource Paging</h2>
      <p>When a client requests a resource, the client should expect that the entire resource will be returned in the response, with all property values. This can be problematic because, in some cases, resources may be so large that a client might not want to retrieve the entire resource in one HTTP response.</p>

      <p>One solution for clients that are sensitive to response size is to check the response size before loading. This method is described in the next section. Another solution is to use Resource Paging.</p>

      <p>Resource Paging specifies a capability for servers to make the state of large resources or long lists of resources available as a list of smaller subset resources (pages) whose representation is easier to produce by the server and consume by clients. Resource paging is particularly useful in handling results from the query capability or the contents of an LDP container.</p>

    <section id="checkingResponseSize">
      <h2>Checking Response Size</h2>

    <p class="conformance">Clients that do not wish to load large resources MAY use the HTTP HEAD method to determine the size of a resource.</p>

    <section id="StablePaging">
    <h3>Stable Paging</h3>

      <p>Some OSLC Servers might wish to guarantee stable paging, meaning that the sequence of pages returned from the server represent a snapshot in time and will not change as the client pages through them. OSLC specifications that require stable paging should state this requirement and specify to which resources it applies.</p>

      <p>Note that because stable paging implementations are based on server-side state, it is possible that the state will expire. <span class='conformance'>Implementations MAY use the HTTP response code 410 (Expired) to indicate to clients that the link they requested has expired.</span></p>

    <h2>Version Compatibility</h2>
    <p>OSLC is intended to provide a foundation for (lifecycle) application interoperability. A significant number of OSLC domains, and client and server implementations already exist and are in common use. Interoperability issues between applications on incompatible OSLC versions could result in negative impact to end users. One of the goals of the OSLC initiative is to mitigate or eliminate the need for lock-step version upgrades, where clients or servers target one version of a specification and break when new versions are introduced -- requiring all services to be upgraded simultaneously.</p>

    <p>OSLC Core and domain specifications will each be versioned independently, and may specify version numbers. Existing OSLC 2.0 clients and servers use the OSLC-Core-Version header described in <a href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OslcCoreSpecification#Specification_Versioning">OSLC Core 2.0 Specification Versioning</a> to indicate what OSLC version they expect or support. But exposing version numbers in OSLC implementations could lead to interoperability issues. Ultimately each domain will decide its compatibility needs. OSLC Core 3.0 does not introduce any changes that would break existing OSLC 2.0 clients. Because of this, there is no need for OSLC Core 3.0 to require servers or clients to utilize an OSLC-Core-Version header with a value of 3.0.</p>

    <p>If an OSLC 2.0 client accesses an OSLC 3.0 server, the 3.0 server will always respond to the client in a manner that is compatible with 2.0. The response may include additional headers and entity request or response body information defined by OSLC Core 3.0, but this information will be simply ignored by the 2.0 clients. There will be no missing or invalid information since OSLC Core 3.0 is designed to be compatible with OSLC Core 2.0.</p>

    <p>For OSLC clients that access 2.0 servers:
      <ul>
        <li>OSLC 1.0 clients - get 1.0 responses by default from 2.0 servers and don't interoperate with 3.0 servers.</li>
        <li>OSLC 2.0 clients - interact with 2.0 servers that may or may not implement 1.0 by using the OSLC-Core-Version header.</li>
        <li>OSLC 3.0 Clients - if they are accessing 2.0 servers that might return 1.0 responses without the header, then they would have to provide the header as specified in <a href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OslcCoreSpecification#Specification_Versioning">OSLC Core 2.0 Specification Versioning</a>,</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>OSLC Core 3.0 does not address compatibility with versions of OSLC prior to [[!OSLCCore2]]. Servers wishing to support compatibility with versions prior to 2.0 should follow <a href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OslcCoreSpecification#Specification_Versioning">OSLC Core 2.0 Specification Versioning</a>.</p>
