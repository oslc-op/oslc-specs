    <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Linked Data has proved to be an effective way to look up and navigate
            information at web scale. It is also emerging as a compelling
            architectural basis for web applications [[RWLD]]. The principles for designing Linked Data web
            applications are standardized by the W3C Linked Data
            Platform Specification 1.0 [[!LDP]].
        </p>

        <p>
            RDF is at the core of Linked Data. The design principles for Linked
            Data [[LDDI]] include the following rule:
        </p>
        <blockquote>When someone looks up a URI, provide useful
            information, using the standards (RDF*, SPARQL)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This emergence of RDF as an important application development
            technology for Linked Data and other domains has brought to light a
            serious gap in the associated technology stack, namely the absence of
            a way to describe the integrity constraints imposed by an application
            on the RDF documents it processes. Here the term <q>integrity
                constraint</q> denotes any characteristic of data required by or
            enforced by an application. Common examples of integrity constraints
            include the mandatory presence of properties, the cardinality of
            relations, and restrictions on the allowed values of properties.
        </p>

        <p>Well-established programming technologies such as relational
            databases, object-oriented programming languages, and XML utilize <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-world_assumption">closed-world assumptions</a> to provide
            schemas or type definitions that encode integrity constraints.
            Applications utilizing RDF and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-world_assumption">open-world assumptions</a> may need a similar mechanism to constrain the open-world for a particular context, and frequently
            start to use RDFS or OWL for this purpose. However, this is a
            misapplication of those technologies.</p>

            <p>RDFS and/or OWL are used to define OSLC vocabularies which specify the terms (classes and properties) and their semantic meaning. Vocabularies don't define constraints on what can be asserted, rather they define the meaning of what was asserted, often through the use of reasoners that introduce inferred assertions. However, there are also situations where a vocabulary needs to be constrained in order to be used in a specific context for a specific purpose. RDFS and OWL are often not useful for this purpose as unless the vocabularies are carefully designed, reasoners can introduce unintended assertions that are not consistent with the specified purpose.
            </p>

        <p>
            This document describes the Resource Shape specification, a
            high-level RDF vocabulary for describing the <em>shape</em> of RDF
            resources. Here the term <q>RDF resource</q> is used to denote an LDPR
            resource that has an RDF document among its set of available
            representations. The term <q>shape</q> is used because it is often
            useful to visualize an RDF document as a topological object, namely
            as a graph consisting of nodes interconnected by arcs. Throughout
            this document the terms <q>RDF resource</q>, <q>RDF document</q>, and
            <q>RDF graph</q> are used more or less interchangeably albeit
            somewhat imprecisely.
        </p>

        <p>The shape of an RDF graph includes both a description of its
            expected contents (properties, types) within some operational context
            (e.g. GET, POST) and the integrity constraints that must be satisfied
            by the contents in that context.</p>

        <p>Resource shapes specify a standard way of describing resources and constraints on resources that may be used in defining among other things, OSLC domain resources. There are other means that OSLC domains may use in addition to or instead of resource shapes such as W3C [[SHACL]] or [[JSONSchema]]. OSLC servers should describe their resources using resource shapes if they wish to integrate with <a href=./oslc-core.html>OSLC Core 3.0</a> clients or servers that are expecting resource shapes. OSLC domain specifications use shapes to specify the constraints on their domain vocabulary elements that must be supported by servers.</p>

        <p>This specification begins with a brief discussion of the use cases
            and requirements that the OSLC Resource Shape Specification addresses. It
            then describes all aspects of the current specification in detail.
            Finally, it concludes with some recommendations for extensions based
            on implementation experience.</p>

    <section id="terms">
        <h1>Terminology</h1>
        <p>Terminology uses and extends the terminology and capabilities of <a href=./oslc-core.html>OSLC Core Overview</a>, W3C Linked Data Platform [[!LDP]], W3C's Architecture of the World Wide Web [[WEBARCH]],  Hyper-text
            Transfer Protocol [[!HTTP11]].</p>
            <p>This specification introduces the following terminology:</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>applicability</dt>
                <dd>
                    Shapes associated with a resource apply to that resource if the shape's <code>oslc:describes</code> property matches the type of the associated resource, or the shape has no <code>oslc:describes</code> property in which case it applies to all resources associated with that shape. For all shapes that "apply to" or describe an associated resource, that resource should satisfy the constraints defined by those shapes. See <a href="#associating-and-applying-shapes">Associating and Applying Shapes</a> for the definition of how shapes are associated with resources, what associated shapes apply to a resource, and what it means if multiple shapes apply to a single resource.
                </dd>

                <dt>association</dt>
                <dd>
                    This specification defines three contexts in which a shape may become
                    associated with a described resource. The described resource itself
                    may link to a shape using the property <a href="#instanceShape">oslc:instanceShape</a>,
                    the described resource may be the entity request to or response from a
                    REST service whose service description links to a shape using the
                    property <a href="#resourceShape">oslc:resourceShape</a>, or the resource may be the object value of an rdf:Property whose applicable <a href="#valueShape">oslc:valueShape</a> links to the constraining shape. More than
                    one shape may become associated with a described resource in a
                    given context. The shapes associated with a resource are the set of shapes to be checked for applicability. Not all the associated shapes are necessarily
                    applicable. Refer to the definition of applicability above.
                </dd>

                <dt>datatype property</dt>
                <dd>A datatype property is a defined property that takes
                    literal values.</dd>

                <dt>defined property</dt>
                <dd>
                    A defined property is a property, such as dcterm:description or
                    oslc_cm:status, of a described resource that is defined by some
                    shape applicable to the described resource in a given context. A
                    shape is linked to its defined properties using the property <a href="#property">oslc:property</a>. A described resource type
                    might have a given defined property in some contexts but not in
                    others. For example, the body of a POST request might have fewer
                    defined properties than the created resource.
                </dd>

                <dt>described resource</dt>
                <dd>A described resource is a resource described by some shape.</dd>

                <dt>document</dt>
                <dd>A representation of a resource. For example, an RDF
                    document may represent a resource.</dd>

                <dt>graph</dt>
                <dd>An RDF document may be regarded as a directed, labeled
                    multi-graph, or, simply, a graph, in which each triple of the
                    document corresponds to an arc of the graph. For each arc in the graph, the source
                    is the subject of its triple, the target is the object of
                    its triple, and the label is the predicate of its triple.</dd>

                    A resource of type <a href="#resourceShape">oslc:ResourceShape</a>

    <section id='use-cases' class='informative'>
    <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>
            This section briefly describes the main use cases that motivate an RDF graph
            shape language. For a more complete discussion of this topic, refer
            to the W3C RDF Validation Workshop [[RDFVAL]].
        </p>

        <section id='describing-apis' class='informative'>
        <h2>Describing RDF APIs</h2>
            <p>Any application that provides programmatic services should
                also provide application programming interface (API) documentation
                to programmers so that they can consume those services. Applications
                that process RDF, including Linked Data web applications, are no
                different than other applications in this respect.</p>

            <p>Although API documentation is normally directed towards human
                programmers, there are also important use cases where other programs
                need to understand the API. For example, consider a generic

                or updating resources. Such a tool needs to understand the expected
                contents of the resource so it can generate a user interface. It
                also needs to understand the applicable integrity constraints so it
                can validate user input before sending it to the service provider or server.
                Furthermore, the server may apply different constraints for
                creation versus update operations.</p>

        <h2>Describing RDF Datasets</h2>
            <p>Users must understand the contents of an RDF dataset in order
                to write SPARQL queries. Understanding the integrity constraints can
                help users write better SPARQL queries. For example, if a property
                is known to always be present, then there is no need to wrap it in
                an OPTIONAL clause.</p>

            <p>Query building tools can take advantage of shape information.
                For example, consider a query builder that allows the user to define
                a query that filters results by selecting allowed values from a
                list. In principle, the query builder could dynamically query the
                dataset to determine the list of values present. However, such a
                query could be slow if the dataset was large. In addition, only
                those values present at the time of the query would appear in the
                list. In contrast, if the query builder had access to shape
                information, then it could avoid the potentially expensive query and
                present the user with the complete list of allowed values, whether
                or not they were actually present in the dataset at that time.</p>

    <h2>Requirements</h2>
        <p>This section describes some high-level requirements for an RDF
            resource shape language. For simplicity, members of a shape language
            are referred to as shape resources. It is to be understood that the
            validity and meaning of a shape resource depends on any other shape
            resources it is linked to.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>A shape language must be able to express the most commonly
                occurring aspects of RDF resources in high-level terms, using
                familiar concepts. Interested parties must be able to
                both understand existing shapes and author new ones.</li>
            <li>A shape resource must be processable using readily available
                RDF technologies. These include RDF parsers and SPARQL processors.</li>
            <li>The constraints defined by a shape resource must be
                verifiable using commonly available technologies, with acceptable
                performance. The performance criteria depend on the use case. For
                example, a tool checking user input must respond quickly. A tool
                validating an entire dataset may run as a batch job, but should
                complete within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. hours, not years).</li>
            <li>A shape language must be extensible so that
                application-specific aspects of resources can be expressed. A
                trade-off of expressiveness at the expense of ease-of-understanding
                is acceptable.</li>
            <li>It must be possible to apply different shapes to the same resources in different contexts in order to use the resources for different purposes.</li>

    <h2>Shape Resources</h2>
        <p>
            This section describes the Resource Shape specification (aka
            the <em>Shapes</em> specification) which is part of <a href=./oslc-core.html>OSLC Core 3.0</a>. The
            Shapes specification defines:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>the contents and meaning of shape resources, and</li>
            <li>how to associate shape resources with resources and services</li>
        </ul>

        <section  id="overview" class='informative'>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                A resource shape is a resource that describes the contents of, and
                constraints on, the RDF representation of other resources. These constraints are intended to be applicable to OSLC core and domain vocabularies in order to express the domains sufficiently to support interoperability between clients and servers that use and support them. Resource shapes specify the minimum an implementation needs to do be considered compliant. Specifically, shape constraints say how OSLC clients and servers must behave if the resources satisfy the applicable shape constraints, but they do not say what clients and servers may do if the applicable constraints are not satisfied.
            </p>
            <p>A shape
                resource itself has an RDF representation which uses the terms
                defined by the oslc: vocabulary. The term <q>shape resource</q> or
                simply <q>shape</q> is sometimes used as shorthand for the more
                verbose phrase <q>the RDF representation of a shape resource</q>
                where this can lead to no confusion. The following sections describe
                all of the RDF vocabulary terms used in shape resources.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Shapes specification is based on a simple conceptual model of
                resources that works well in practice, but is somewhat biased
                towards the view that the RDF representation of a resource looks
                like a set of property-value pairs on that resource. The Shapes
                specification works well when the resource being described appears
                as a subject node in its RDF graph and all other nodes are connected
                to the resource node by a path consisting of one or more properties.
                Each property-value pair is represented by a triple in which the
                subject is the resource, the predicate is the property, and the
                object is the value. The value may be either a literal or a
                resource. When the object is a resource, that resource may itself be
                described by another shape. Thus the Shapes specification is
                powerful enough to describe complex graphs. Although the Shapes
                specification works well in practice, it cannot describe arbitrary
                RDF graphs.
            </p>

            <p>The following diagram summarizes the main concepts and
                relations used in this specification:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/shapes-overview.png" height="305" width="640" alt=""> <figcaption>Diagram of main concepts and relations.</figcaption> </figure>
            <p>In this diagram the boxes represent resource types and the
                arrows represent the relations between them that are defined by the
                Shapes specification. The two boxes on the left represent external
                types of resources that use shapes. The other three boxes represent
                the resource types that are defined by the Shapes specification.</p>
            <p>
                The box labeled <q>Resource Shape</q> represents a shape. A shape
                is a resource of <code>rdf:type</code> <a href="#resourceShape-shape">oslc:ResourceShape</a>.
                A shape describes a set of resources. A shape is basically a set of
                one or more defined properties that any resource described by that shape is expected to
                contain.
            </p>

            <p>
                The box labeled <q>Property</q> represents a defined property. A
                defined property is a resource of rdf:type <a href="#property-shape">oslc:Property</a>.
                The arrow labeled <q>property</q> represents the aggregation
                relation between a shape and its defined properties. The predicate
                of this relation is <a href="#property">oslc:property</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each <a href="#property-shape">oslc:Property</a> resource has a set of
                properties that describe the defined property and the constraints on its use within any resource that the given shape applies to. These include a
                description of the values of the defined property and the number of its occurrences or cardinality
                within the resource. The value of a defined property may be a
                literal, a resource, or either. If the value of a defined property
                is a resource, then defined property may refer to another <a href="#resourceShape-shape">oslc:ResourceShape</a> resource that
                describes the value resource. This relation is depicted by the arrow
                labeled <q>valueShape</q>. The predicate of this relation is <a href="#valueShape">oslc:valueShape</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The value of a defined property may be constrained to take one of an
                allowed set of values. In some cases, the allowed set of values may
                be large and be used in many shapes. In this case it is useful to
                put the allowed values in a separate resource so they can be easily
                reused. The box labeled <q>Allowed Values</q> represents a resource
                of rdf:type <a href="#allowedValues-shape">oslc:AllowedValues</a>. The
                arrow labeled <q>allowedValues</q> represents the relation between
                a defined property and its set of allowed values. The predicate of
                this relation is <a href="#allowedValues">oslc:allowedValues</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                A [[REST]] service may describe aspects of
                its interface contract using shapes. For example, a REST service may
                provide a URI where new resources can be created via HTTP POST. This
                service could describe the expected contents of POST request bodies
                using shapes. Similarly, a REST service may provide a URI that
                represents a container of resources and could describe those
                resources using shapes. The box labeled <q>any service</q>
                represents any REST service description. The arrow labeled <q>resourceShape</q>
                represents the predicate <a href="#resourceShape">oslc:resourceShape</a>
                which is a property of the service description resource.
            </p>
            <p>
                Similarly, any resource can describe its own contents by linking to
                a shape resource. The box labeled <q>any resource</q> represents
                any resource. The arrow labeled <q>instanceShape</q> represents the
                predicate <a href="#instanceShape">oslc:instanceShape</a> which is a
                property of the resource.

                    The RDF representation contains one <a href="#resourceShape">oslc:ResourceShape</a>
                    resource and two <a href="#property-shape">oslc:Property</a> resources.
                    The <a href="#resourceShape">oslc:ResourceShape</a> resource
                    contains a short description of the shape using <a href="#dcterms:title">dcterms:title</a>, gives the RDF type of the

                    and lists the two properties contained in the resource being

                    resources. Each <a href="#property-shape">oslc:Property</a> resource
                    specifies the URI of the RDF property it is defining using <a href="#propertyDefinition">oslc:propertyDefinition</a>, and the
                    occurrence of that property using <a href="#occurs">oslc:occurs</a>.
                    The occurrence of each property is specified using the terms <a href="#Exactly-one">oslc:Exactly-one</a> and <a href="#Zero-or-one">oslc:Zero-or-one</a> which indicate that the

                <p>In this example, only the occurrence and allowed values
                    constraints are used. The Shapes specification provides for

                Property tables are used below to describe the resources defined by
                the Shapes specification, namely <a href="#resourceShape">oslc:ResourceShape</a>,
                <a href="#property-shape">oslc:Property</a>, and <a href="#allowedValues-shape">oslc:AllowedValues</a>.
                A property table is a tabular depiction of a subset of the
                information that can be specified using shapes. Each table describes
                one type of resource. Each row describes one property of the
                resource. Each column describes some aspect of the properties. The
                columns have the following meanings:
            </p>
            <dl>
                <dt><i>Prefixed Name</i></dt>
                <dd>
                    The compact IRI [<a href="#IRI">IRI</a>] of the defined property
                    being described in the current row of the table. This corresponds
                    to the <a href="#propertyDefinition">oslc:propertyDefinition</a>
                    property.
                </dd>

                <dt><i>Occurs</i></dt>
                <dd>
                    The number of times the defined property may occur. This
                    corresponds to the <a href="#occurs">oslc:occurs</a> property.
                </dd>

                <dt><i>Read-Only</i></dt>
                <dd>
                    <code>true</code> if the property is read-only. If omitted, or set to false, then the property is writable.
                </dd>

                <dt><i>Value-Type</i></dt>
                <dd>
                    The type of the values of the defined property. This corresponds to
                    the <a href="#valueType">oslc:valueType</a> property. A defined
                    property that takes literal values is called a <em>datatype
                        property</em>. A defined property that links to another resource is
                    called an <em>object property</em>. The resource linked to is
                    called the <em>object resource</em>. For datatype properties, this
                    property gives the datatype URI of the literal values. For object
                    properties, this property specifies whether the object resource has
                    a URI (Resource), is a blank node (LocalResource), or is any
                    resource (AnyResource). These values correspond to <a

                <dd>
                    For object properties, the location of the representation of the
                    object resource. This corresponds to the <a href="#representation">oslc:representation</a>
                    property. The representation of the object resource may be
                    contained in the same document as the described resource (Inline),
                    or it may be contained in a remote document (Reference), or it may
                    be either (Either). These values correspond to <a href="#Inline">oslc:Inline</a>,
                    <a href="#Reference">oslc:Reference</a>, and <a href="#Either">oslc:Either</a>. Domain vocabulary designers should carefully consider restrictions on representations, such as requiring <a href="#Reference">oslc:Reference</a>instead of <a href="#Either">oslc:Either</a>, in order to provide maximum flexibility.

                <dt><i>Range</i></dt>
                <dd>
                    For object properties, the allowed rdf:type(s) of the object
                    resources. This corresponds to the <a href="#range">oslc:range</a>
                    property. This value may be Any if any type is allowed. The value
                    Any corresponds to <a href="#Any">oslc:Any</a>.

        <div>
            <p>
                If present and true, <code>oslc:readOnly</code> is used to specify that the value
                of defined property is managed by the service, i.e. that it is
                read-only. It cannot be directly modified by clients of the
                service. <span class='conformance'>Services <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> ignore
                attempts to modify read-only properties, but <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span>
                fail such requests. If a service ignores an attempt to modify a
                read-only property then it <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD NOT</span>
                do so silently. A service <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> use the
                HTTP Warning header or some other means to indicate that the attempt
                to modify a read-only property has been ignored.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this context, modification means a change in any object of the
                triples associated with the defined property. For example, a GET
                request followed by a PUT request would not modify the triples. <span class='conformance'>A
                service <span class="rfc2119">MUST NOT</span> interpret a PUT
                request that does not modify the triples associated with the defined
                property as a violation of the oslc:readOnly constraint.</a>
            </p>
            <p>Examples of read-only properties include creation and
                modification timestamps, the identity of who created or modified the
                described resource, and properties computed from the values of other
                properties.</p>
            <p>When modifying a resource, it is natural for a client to
                first retrieve its current representation using a GET request. This
                request will return read-only properties along with read-write
                properties. If a service fails PUT requests that contain read-only
                properties then clients will have to remove all read-only
                properties before submitting PUT requests. The behavior of ignoring
                read-only properties in PUT requests is therefore more convenient
                for clients. Similarly, when copying a resource, a client would
                GET it first. It is therefore more convenient for clients if the
                service ignores read-only properties also in POST requests.</p>

  <p>In addition, the OSLC Open Project would like to call out special recognition of the significant contribution by the originators of the Resource Shape concepts. The OSLC Resource Shape specification was
    initially developed by the OSLC Reporting Workgroup under the
    leadership of Tack Tong (IBM), with major contributions from Arthur
    Ryman (IBM) and Martin Nally (IBM). Members of OSLC workgroups found
    shapes to be applicable to other aspects of OSLC and so the
    specification was subsequently integrated into the OSLC Core
    specification by Dave Johnson (IBM).</p>

  <p>
    Anamitra Bhattacharyya (IBM) provided valuable feedback based on
    implementation experience and input on datatype facets. Steve Speicher (IBM)
    and John Arwe (IBM) contributed proposals for extending shapes which has informed the [[SHACL]] work.
