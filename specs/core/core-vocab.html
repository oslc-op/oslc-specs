    <section id="motivation" class="informative">
      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        Most OSLC vocabularies and resource shape constraints on usages of those vocabularies are given in the various
        OSLC domain specifications. The motivation for these domain specifications is to define agreed upon, formalized
        vocabulary terms for key elements in the domain. Domain vocabularies are not intended to restrict what
        vocabularies servers actually use for those domains, or what domains they support. Rather vocabularies establish
        a common core of domain terms that reduce accidental variability and foster greater interchange and
        interoperability between tools that support and users that make use of domains. Servers are free to extend the
        domains and integrate across domains as required to realize their provided capabilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        OSLC Core takes a similar approach for common terms that are used across most domains. The intent is to provide
        a foundation for building domains that again reduces unnecessary variability, and eliminates the need for the
        various domain specifications to redundantly define similar terms. The follow paragraphs describe the kinds of
        common terms defined by OSLC core in order to achieve the stated intent.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a title="">Archived Resource</a>s are typically found in large systems in which an immutable copy of the state
        of a resource at a given time is captured. The purpose may vary in that it could be simply a way to facilitate
        access to a backup or snapshot of a resource at a particular point in time. Another use may be to indicate that
        a resource has been deleted, but is saved by the system for historical or legal reasons. Having a consistent way
        to indicate that a resource, or a set of them, has been archived helps when defining certain views of the
        resources or queries. Archived Resources may be identified by having a property <code>oslc:archived</code>, with
        value <code>true</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many different kinds of applications have a way to provide comments or notes related to a given resource. These
        take the form of a discussion, with a sequence of comments. OSLC Core provide a common way for applications to
        easily add to a comment to a discussion thread or navigate a discussion thread.
      </p>

      <p>
        Error responses from HTTP request often take the form of HTML pages intended for a human to read, even though
        these requests are often initiated from applications that don't have a human actively monitoring it. OSLC Core
        defines a consistent way to request error responses of a certain format, and a prescribed interaction model that
        helps clients better handle errors automatically.
      </p>

      <p>
        Consider a user interface for a query builder that allows users to build queries about test cases. It is natural
        for the query builder to present the user with a list of the properties that apply to test cases that could be
        used in the query. Suppose the user wants to build a query that returns all the requirements that are validated
        by a test case. The query builder should describe the available properties from the point of view of the test
        case. This implies that the query builder should describe the inverse relation asserted by any triple that has
        the test case as an object. In this example, the query builder should describe assertions of the form
        {requirement <code>oslc_rm:validatedBy</code> test case} as {test case <code>validates</code> requirement}.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some RDF properties express relations or links between subject and object artifacts. If a change in state of
        subject and/or object of a triple may result in the assertion becoming invalid, the link may be seen to
        represent a dependency. OSLC Core provides property <code>oslc:impactType</code> as a means of defining the
        dependency represented by an RDF property.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="enumerations" class="informative">
      <h2>Defining Enumerations</h2>
      <p>
        Some property values are are characterized by a limited set of enumerated values. The type for these property
        values is called an enumeration in many modeling and programming languages, while the values are called
        enumeration literals. RDF does not define a specific way of defining enumerated types and enumeration literals.
        As a result, different vocabularies may take different, but equally valid approaches. In order to foster
        interoperability and integration, OSLC Core provides a recommended approach for defining enumerated types and
        enumeration literals. This approach is used in defining the OSLC Core vocabulary terms.
      </p>

      <p>
        Enumerations in an OSLC vocabulary should be defined as an RDF class. Enumeration literals are the URIs of
        individuals of that class. For example, consider an enumeration called "Color" that has enumeration literals
        <code>{red, yellow, green, blue}</code> (using Java notation). Color would be defined as an RDF class and the
        enumeration literals would be individuals of that class. A <code>color</code> property is defined and then used
        to assert that the color of myCar is blue.
      </p>
      <pre class="example">
# Color enumeration
Color
    a rdfs:Class ;
    rdfs:label "Color" ;
    rdfs:comment "The class of possible color values." .

# Color enumeration literals
red
    a Color ;
    rdfs:label "red" .

yellow
    a Color ;
    rdfs:label "yellow" .

green
    a Color ;
    rdfs:label "green" .

blue
    a Color ;
    rdfs:label "blue" .

# A Color property
color
    a rdf:Property ;
    rdfs:label "color" ;
    rdfs:comment "Used to specify the color of a resource".

# Asserting the color of a resource
myCar color blue.
        </pre
      >
      <p>
        Enumerations can be open or closed. Open enumerations allow additional enumeration literals to be added as
        needed. Closed enumerations have a fixed set of enumeration literals that is not intended to be extended.
        Resource shapes can be used to constrain enumerations to a specific set of values. Notice in the example above
        that the color property did not specify its rdfs:range. This keeps the enumeration completely open to any set of
        individuals. OSLC prefers to use resource shapes to constrain resources for particular usages, leaving them open
        for extension for other, possibly unanticipated usages.
      </p>

      <p>
        A shape can be used to constrain the Color enumeration for a specific purpose. For example, the color of lights
        in a traffic light should be constrained to exactly red, yellow and green.
      </p>
      <pre class="example">
# Create a constraint on Color for traffic lights
TrafficLightConstraint
    a oslc:ResourceShape ;
    oslc:describes fhwa:TrafficLight ;
    determs:title "Establish constraints for traffic light colors" ;
    oslc:property colorConstraint .

colorConstraint
    a oslc:Property ;
    oslc:name "color" ;
    dcterms:description "The colors for a traffic light as specified by FHWA."
    oslc:propertyDefinition color ;
    oslc:occurs oslc:Exactly-one ;
    oslc:range Color ;
    oslc:allowValue red, yellow, green ;
    oslc:readOnly false ;
    oslc:representation oslc:Reference ;
    oslc:valueType oslc:Resource .
        </pre
      >
      <p>
        TrafficLightConstraint defines a constraint associated with the vocabulary term <code>fhwa:TrafficLight</code>.
        The constraint has one property, colorConstraint whose <code>oslc:propertyDefinition</code> is the color RDF
        property. The <code>oslc:range</code> for the colorConstraint is set to Color, meaning the value of the
        applicable property is constrained to be of <code>rdf:type</code> Color. The
        <code>oslc:allowedValue</code> property further constrains the values to be red, yelow, or green. If the
        <code>oslc:allowedValue</code> were not specified, then the TrafficLightConstraint would allow the enumeration
        to be open.
      </p>

      <p>
        A completely different shape constraint could be used for colors that represent the status of a risk mitigation
        in a software development project.

      <h2>Terms for describing vocabularies</h2>

      <section id="invLabels">
        <h2>Inverse Labels</h2>

        <p>
          The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/">W3C RDF Schema vocabulary</a> defines the vocabulary annotation
          property <code>rdfs:label</code>. This property is intended to provide a human-readable description for a
          resource’s name. It is often used to provide a label for RDF properties. [[LinkGuidance]] discourages the
          creation of inverse predicates. However, there is still a need for a property, like rdfs:label, to specify an
          inverse label for a predicate.
        </p>

        <p>
          For example, consider the OSLC Requirements Management (RM) property oslc_rm:validatedBy. When used as the
          predicate of a triple, this property is used to assert that the subject resource, e.g. a Requirement, is
          validated by the object resource, e.g. a TestCase. The rdfs:label for this property is “validatedBy”.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now consider the user interface of a query builder that allows users to build queries about TestCases. It is
          natural for the query builder to present the user with a list of the properties that apply to TestCases.
          Suppose the user wants to build a query that returns all the Requirements that are validated by a TestCase.
          The query builder should describe the available properties from the point of view of the TestCase. This
          implies that the query builder should describe the inverse relation asserted by any triple that has the
          TestCase as an object. In our example, the query builder should describe oslc_rm:validatedBy as “validates”.
        </p>

        <p>The oslc:inverseLabel property provides a human-readable label for the inverse of the subject property.</p>

        <p>For example, the following triple (in Turtle notation) would be added to the OSLC RM vocabulary:</p>

        <pre class="example">
            oslc_rm:validatedBy oslc:inverseLabel "validates".
            </pre
        >

        <p>
          It should be noted that the use of inverse labels is independent of the existence of explicit RDF inverse
          properties. However, if an inverse property is defined by some vocabulary, then a consistent label should be
          used in order to avoid confusion. In general, it is good practice to avoid the creation of inverse properties
          since it creates redundant information and complicates SPARQL queries. Instead, a single property should be
          wherever possible and it should be given an inverse label in order to describe the property from the
          perspective of the object.
        </p>

        <p>
          For example, the
          <a href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/QmVocabulary">OSLC Quality Management (QM) vocabulary</a>
          defines two properties that are approximately inverse to oslc_rm:validatedBy. These are
          oslc_qm:validatesRequirement and oslc_qm:validatesRequirementCollection. In this case the choice of inverse
          label “validates” for oslc_rm:validatedBy is consistent with the actual labels of the inverse properties,
          namely “validatesRequirement” and “validatesRequirementCollection”.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="traceabilityAndImpact">
        <h2>Traceability and Impact type</h2>

        <p>
          Some RDF properties express dependency relations between artifacts, and it is often very valuable to trace the
          impact of a change in an artifact to those artifacts that depend on it directly or indirectly. The concept of
          dependency is very general. For example, the concept of trace relations is described in SysML: “A generic
          trace requirement relationship provides a general-purpose relationship between a requirement and any other
          model element. The semantics of trace include no real constraints and therefore are quite weak.”
        </p>

        <p>
          As a general guideline, if any assertion involving a given predicate may become invalid if the state of either
          its subject or object resources change, then we may legitimately regard that predicate as expressing a
          dependency relation, in which case it may be useful to explicitly describe the nature of the dependency.
        </p>

        <p>
          An assertion describes a link between subject and object resources whose name is the property or predicate of
          the assertion. A dependency relationship may be in the same direction as the link, the opposite direction,
          both directions, or the link may not represent any dependency whose impact might need to be assessed.
        </p>

        <p>
          For example, in assertions such as {requirement validatedBy testcase}, it may be important to assess the
          impact of a change in the requirement or a change in the testcase. Typically test cases are updated to reflect
          changes in requirements in order perform the correct validation. So in this case, property validatedBy would
          introduce impact that follows the link, from the subject requirement to the object testcase. However, if a
          team is doing test-driven development, they may treat test cases as formal, executable specifications of
          requirements and the requirement is simply an informal description of the test case. In this case, the team
          might consider the impact to be opposite of the link, from the testcase to the requirement.
        </p>

        <p>
          The property <code>oslc:impactType</code> asserts that the subject property is a dependency relation and gives
          the direction of impact. The resources <code>oslc:FollowsLink</code> and
          <code>oslc:OppositeLink</code> identify whether the impact follows the direction of the assertion (subject to
          object), or the opposite direction (object to subject). <code>oslc:SymmetricImpact</code> describes a
          symmetric dependency relation in which the property represents a dependency from both subject to object and
          object to subject. <code>oslc:NoImpact</code> indicates the predicate does not represent any dependency
          between the subject and object resources.
        </p>

        <p>
          For example, the following triple (in Turtle notation) would be added a vocabulary to indicate test cases are
          dependent on requirements:
        </p>

        <pre class="example">ex:validatedBy oslc:impactType oslc:FollowsLink .</pre>

        <p>
          The same dependency could also be described from the perspective of the test case. In this case, the
          dependency is opposite of the validatesRequirement predicate:
        </p>

        <pre class="example">
ex:validatesRequirement oslc:impactType oslc:OppositeImpact .
ex:validatesRequirementCollection oslc:impactType oslc:OppositeImpact.</pre
