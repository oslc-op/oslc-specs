      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Various tools handle the association and creation of related resources in conceptually similar ways, but often
        differ in details on how it is accomplished. The Linked Data Platform (LDP) already defines a model by which it
        is possible to relate resources to another, even if they are not RDF-based. This specification defines the
        method to create associated attachments to a given resource and understand if that resource supports the
        attaching of attachments.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an example of how to create an attachment, simply HTTP POST the attachment content to the attachment
        container for the resource. The request should have a <code>Content-Type</code> header describing the
        attachment's media type. The optional <code>Slug</code> header is used to give the attachment a name.
      </p>

      <pre class="example">
POST /bugs/2314/attachments HTTP/1.1
Slug: design
Content-Type: application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.text
Content-Length: 18124

[binary content]
</pre
      >

      <p>
        The response contains a Link to the new attachment in the <code>Location</code> header. This server has also
        included a Link to the <code>oslc:AttachmentDescriptor</code> for the attachment in the HTTP response, which
        contains metadata about the attachment.
      </p>

      <pre class="example">
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Allow: GET,HEAD,OPTIONS,POST

      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        Most users of lifecycle tools have the need to easily create attachments across a variety of integrated tools
        and associate them to some lifecycle resource in context to some scenario. Some specific scenarios where this
        touches cross tool integration:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Running application scanning</strong> : automatically creating a defect or task to track a problem,
          attaching a log file that outlines the details of the problem.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Publishing build results</strong> : as part of an automated software build, publish successful build
          artifacts to an asset management repository
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mockups of app design</strong> : share screenshots and designs to a given user story (requirement)
        </li>
      </ul>

    <section id="concepts" class="informative">
      <h2>Basic Concepts</h2>
      <!-- TODO: Consider adding a simple diagram showing relationship from: resource->(container & member properties)->attachdescriptor -->
      <p>
        Attachments are added to a resource via a simple POST request to the appropriate LDP-Container resource. The
        entity body becomes the content of the attachment resource. The attachment may automatically be associated with
        the resource via some membership relationship, which may use the <code>oslc:attachment</code> membership
        predicate. Statements are also automatically added to the <code>oslc:AttachmentDescriptor</code> resource. The
        property values are assigned by the server or can be determined from standard headers of the POST. The following
        table maps the HTTP request headers from the POST request to create the attachment resource, to what can be used
        to derive the initial values in the indicated <code>oslc:AttachmentDescriptor</code> resource:
      </p>

            <th><strong>HTTP Request Header</strong></th>

      <h2>Working with Attachments</h2>

      The following examples illustrate how a client can work with attachments.

      <section id="ex_find_attachment">
        <h2>Find the Attachments for a Resource</h2>

        <p>Clients get the attachments for a resource by:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Finding the attachment container for a resource using an HTTP OPTIONS method and Link header</li>
          <li>Getting the container for the list of attachments</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Each resource that supports attachments has an attachment container, which is an LDP container. Clients
          discover the attachment container through an HTTP Link header. A client can use GET or HEAD to get the Link
          header, but OPTIONS is often more efficient because the server does not have to calculate the ETag or content
          length of the response. LDP resources must support HTTP OPTIONS, and responses to all HTTP requests for
          resources that support attachments must have the Link header.
        </p>

        <pre class="example">
OPTIONS /bugs/2314 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
</pre
        >

        <p>
          The response contains a Link to the attachment container with Link relation
          <code>http://open-services.net/ns/core#AttachmentContainer</code>. Note that other Link headers are in the
          response. In fact, LDP requires additional Link headers, which is why the response has a Link with relation
          <code>type</code> and target URI <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Resource</code>.
        </p>

        <pre class="example">
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Allow: GET,HEAD,OPTIONS,PUT,DELETE
Link: &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Resource&gt;; rel="type",
      &lt;http://example.com/bugs/2314/attachments&gt;; rel="http://open-services.net/ns/core#AttachmentContainer"
</pre
        >

        <p>
          Now the client requests the attachment container to see the attachments for this resource. It's a good
          practice to include an HTTP <code>Prefer</code> header to explicitly ask the server for the LDP containment
          triples.
        </p>

        <pre class="example">
GET /bugs/2314/attachments HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Accept: text/turtle
Prefer: return=representation; include="http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#PreferContainment"
</pre
        >

        <p>
          The response is an LDP container for the attachments. It can be any LDP container such as an
          <code>ldp:BasicContainer</code> or an <code>ldp:DirectContainer.</code> This example uses an
          <code>ldp:BasicContainer</code>. The attachment container only contains attachments for a single resource.
        </p>

        <pre class="example">

</pre
        >

        <p>Clients can look at the <code>ldp:contains</code> property on the container for the attachments.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="ex_get_attachment">
        <h2>Get the Attachment Content</h2>

        <p>
          Once clients have the attachment URI, they can get the attachment by simply making an HTTP GET request to the
          attachment URI.
        </p>

        <p>
          A <code>Slug</code> header can be included by a server in the response to a <code>GET</code> on an attachment
          resource. If a client wishes to store the content as a file, this value provides a hint as to the file name to
          use (subject, of course, to any file system restrictions). In the absence of an <code>Slug</code> header, the
          client may use the last segment of the resource's URI as a hint, or just choose an arbitrary file name.
        </p>

        <pre class="example">
GET /bugs/2314/attachments/1 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
</pre
        >

        <p>
          The response body is the attachment content. Servers should set the response <code>Content-Type</code> to
          describe the media type of the attachment. The response may have a <code>Content-Disposition</code> header
          with a filename parameter, although this isn't required. This example also contains a Link with relation
          <code>describedby</code>, which links to the <code>oslc:AttachmentDescriptor</code> for the attachment.
        </p>

        <pre class="example">
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Allow: GET,HEAD,OPTIONS,PUT,DELETE
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="screenshot.png"

      <section id="ex_create_attachment">
        <h2>Create an Attachment</h2>

        <p>
          To create an attachment, POST the attachment content to the attachment container for the resource. The request
          should have a <code>Content-Type</code> header describing the attachment's media type and subtype as specified
          in <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/">Media Types</a>. The optional
          <code>Slug</code> header is used to give the attachment a name. The <code>Content-Length</code> header is used
          to initialize the attachment size.
        </p>

        <p>
          A client can set a <code>Slug</code> header in the attachment-creating POST to specify a hint for a name for
          the resource as part of that single request. This can be important as some systems require a name at the time
          the attachment is created. Different systems may have different requirements for valid attachment names, so
          the value of the <code>Slug</code> header should be interpreted as a hint in this context. If the given name
          can not be used as specified, it is transformed into a valid name. If that is not possible or the header is
          not specified, an arbitrary value is assigned. Failure due to an invalid name is undesirable because of the
          potentially large size of an attachment resource.
        </p>

        <p>
          The client can provide the attachment size in the <code>Content-Length</code> header and this can be used to
          initialize the <code>oslc:AttachmentDescriptor</code> <code>oslc:attachmentSize</code> property. The server
          may compute a different attachment size than that provided by the client if the client specified value is
          incorrect or not provided.
        </p>

        <pre class="example">
POST /bugs/2314/attachments HTTP/1.1
Slug: design
Content-Type: application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.text
Content-Length: 18124

[binary content]
</pre
        >

        <p>
          The response contains a Link to the new attachment in the <code>Location</code> header. This server has also
          included a Link to the <code>oslc:AttachmentDescriptor</code> for the attachment in the HTTP response, which
          contains metadata about the attachment.
        </p>

        <p>
          When a server successfully creates an attachment resource, it responds with an HTTP status code of 201
          (created) with the URI of the newly created attachment resource in the HTTP response
          <code>Location</code> header. Additionally, if the server created an associated
          <code>oslc:AttachmentDescriptor</code> resource, the URI for this resource should be listed in the HTTP
          response <code>Link</code> header [[!RFC8288]] with <code>rel="describedby"</code> [[!LDP]].
        </p>

        <p>
          Properties for the AttachmentDescriptor that are not readOnly, such as its title and description, can be
          updated using the usual HTTP <code>PUT</code> method.

          The server typically responds with a 204 No Content status if the request succeeds. It also updates an
          associated attachment metadata in the <code>oslc:AttachmentDescriptor</code> in the
          <code>describedby</code> link. For example, the client could have included a <code>Slug</code> header on the
          update request in order to rename the attachment.

          To remove an attachment, make a DELETE request on the attachment URI. This removes the attachment from the
          container and deletes the content and attachment metadata from the server.

        <h2>Include Attachment Information Inline with a Resource</h2>

        <p>
          Servers can choose to include the attachment information directly in the HTTP response for a resource although
          this isn't required. Here is an example defect resource that contains attachments. The attachment container is
          an <code>ldp:DirectContainer</code> where the membership resource is the defect itself. The membership
          predicate is <code>oslc:attachment</code>, although this predicate is not required. The following example
          shows the results of an <code>HTTP GET</code> on <code>http://example.com/bugs/2314</code>.

          This document applies the following constraints to the

        <p class="conformance">
          An OSLC server providing the Attachments capability MUST implement the vocabulary defined in this section.

        <p>
          The <code>oslc:AttachmentDescriptor</code> resource type is used to describe the binary resource (or non-RDF
          Resource) associated with a particular resource. When a client POSTs an attachment content to a server, the
          server stores the attachment content and assigns a URI just like any other type of resource creation but it
          may also create an <code>oslc:AttachmentDescriptor</code> resource to contain data about the attachment.
        </p>

        <p>
          There is no restriction on the content of each attachment resource. For example, it could be a photo of a
          kitten, an installation manual, a log file, or a source code patch. Since the attachment cannot be expected to
          contain additional client or server supplied data, a typical set of properties for each attachment is included
          with the <code>oslc:AttachmentDescriptor</code> resource itself. Thus, the object of each
          <code>oslc:attachment</code> statement is the binary attachment. Issuing an HTTP HEAD or GET operation on that
          binary attachment resource URL should produce an HTTP response with a header value of
          <code>Link: rel='describedBy'</code> to indicate the URL of the
          <code>oslc:AttachmentDescriptor</code> resource. The properties for the
          <code>oslc:AttachmentDescriptor</code> resource are indicated in the table below.
