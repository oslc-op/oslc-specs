        This specification defines the OSLC Asset Management domain, a RESTful web services interface for the management
        of domain specifica and supporting resources defined in the OSLC Core specification. To support these scenarios,
        this specification defines a set of HTTP-based RESTful interfaces in terms of HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT and
        DELETE, HTTP response codes, content type handling and resource formats.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>This section is non-normative.</p>
      <p>
        Asset management systems allow enterprises to catalog, govern, manage, search for, and maintain assets. An asset
        is anything tangible or intangible that provides value through reference or reuse across a wide audience over an
        extended period of time. Assets typically have a lifecycle and require a formal process to govern both
        modification and access. Cataloging assets with standardized taxonomies controls usage and discovery by end
        users. Assets may also have relationships to and dependencies on other assets.
      </p>

      <p>
        The term asset in this specification generally refers to either software, documentation, or representations of
        equipment. While other definitions of an asset may be appropriate, financial instruments are not considered an
        asset in this specification.
      </p>

      <p>
        Example software assets may include but are not limited to the final binary output from a software development
        process, libraries such as a Java archive (JAR) or dynamic-link library (DLL), and installable packages that are
        distributed through digital distribution platforms such as a repository or app store. Documentation assets may
        include presentation materials, reports, specifications, blue prints, and instructions. Assets may also
        represent any type of equipment or structure such as computer hardware, automobiles, pumps, buildings, etc.
      </p>

      <p>
        Assets are described by a set of properties and zero or more artifacts. An artifact is a file of any type and a
        set of properties that describe the file.
      </p>

      <p>
        This specification builds on the Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC) Core v2.0 Specification to
        define the resources, properties and operations supported by an OSLC Asset Management (OSLC-Asset) provider.
        Asset Management resources include Assets, Artifacts and supporting resources defined in the OSLC Core
        specification. The properties defined describe these resources and the relationships between resources.
        Operations are defined in terms of HTTP methods and MIME type handling. The resources, properties and operations
        defined do not form a comprehensive interface to Asset Management, but instead target specific integration use
        cases documented by the OSLC-Asset workgroup.
      </p>

      <p>
        This specification also defines how Assets and Artifacts are represented in OSLC Services. The
        [[!OSLCAssetResourceDefinition]] is a set of properties for an Asset, and includes properties that describe
        Artifacts of an Asset.

      <section id="terminology" class="informative">
        <h2>Terminology</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Asset Consumer</strong> - A tool or user that performs asset searching and retrieval activities
          outlined in the search and retrieve scenarios.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Asset Resource</strong> - An Asset Resource has a set of properties representing an asset. These
          properties include such things as name, description, classification, and the Artifact properties for an Asset.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Asset Query Resource</strong> - When filtering using simple query, the representation of a list of
          Asset Resources.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Asset Submitter</strong> - A tool or user that performs asset preparation activities outlined in the
          publish scenario.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Artifact</strong> - This term refers to the properties that describe an Asset Artifact and potentially
          the Artifact Media referenced by this Artifact. An Asset may have zero or more Artifacts.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Artifact Fragment</strong> - Fragment within an Asset Resource that describes an Artifact Media
          Resource. The term fragment is associated with an Artifact instead of resource because Artifacts are
          referenced by the Asset&#8217;s URL with a fragment identifier. Artifacts are considered to be contained
          within the asset and when the asset is deleted the artifact is also deleted. While two different Artifacts in
          separate Assets may reference to the same Artifact Media Resource, two different Assets may not contain the
          same Artifact.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Artifact Media Resource</strong> - The Artifact Media Resource represents the actual artifact content.
          The content can be a presentation, a test case, a binary software component, or any other kind of file.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Property</strong> - An attribute of a resource. Typically a property is a name/value pair that
          describes a certain aspect of the resource. For example, an asset has many properties such as the asset title,
          subject/short description, version.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Service Provider</strong> - An implementation of the OSLC Asset Management specification as a server.
          OSLC Asset Management clients consume these services.
        </p>

          <h4>Content Negotiation</h4>

          <p>
            OSLC Core Guidance clearly points to RDF representations (and specifically RDF/XML) as a convention that all
            OSLC Provider implementations minimally provide and accept. OSLC Asset Provider implementations are strongly
            encouraged to adopt this convention. Future versions of this specification are expected to require RDF
            representations for all operations and relax requirements for specialized XML representations.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>XML Representation</strong> - identified by the <code>application/xml</code> content type. Format
            representation rules are outlined in Core [[!OSLCCore2RepresentationGuidance]] Formats section
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>RDF/XML Representation</strong> - identified by the <code>application/rdf+xml</code> content type.
            No additional guidance is given. The OSLC Core describes an algorithm for generating consistent formats that
            are used as examples only.

          <p>
            <strong>JSON Representation</strong> - identified by the <code>application/json</code> content type. Format

            resource request or a collection of resources by query. If the <code>oslc.properties</code> parameter is

            provided in the content, the server MUST set the resource&#8217;s property to a null or empty value. If the

        <h3>Labels for Relationships</h3>

        <p class="conformance">
          Asset relationships to other resources are represented as properties whose values are the URI of the object or
          target resource. When an Asset relationship property is to be presented in a user interface, it may be helpful
          to provide an informative and useful textual label for that relationship instance. (This in addition to the
          relationship property URI and the object resource URI, which are also candidates for presentation to a user.)
          To this end, OSLC providers MAY support a <code>dcterms:title</code> link property in Asset resource
          representations, using the anchor approach outlined in the OSLC Core Links Guidance. In addition to the
          textual label, the Asset resource definition defines several properties that can be used to describe the
          relationship from one Asset resource to another Asset resource.

        <h3>Custom Properties</h3>

        <p class="conformance">
          Asset management providers SHOULD allow consumers to define custom properties. If providers allow consumers to
          define custom properties, they MUST allow the consumer to optionally specify an HTTP URI for that data
          element, and the specified URI MUST be used in the RDF representation of all resources that contain the data
          element. The specified URI MAY be part of an industry standard such as DC, FOAF, or OSLC, or it MAY be defined
          by the user&#8217;s organization. If the URI is defined by the user&#8217;s organization, then they SHOULD
          make it dereferencable as per the [[!W3CBestPractices]].
        </p>

        <p class="conformance">
          If the user does not specify the optional URI, then the provider MUST use a default generated HTTP URI. The
          generated URI SHOULD be as human-readable as possible. One method for achieving human-readability is to apply
          a human-friendly name mangling algorithm to the user-defined label for the data element. The tool SHOULD make
          the generated URI dereferencable as per the [[!W3CBestPractices]]. The published RDF vocabulary SHOULD include
          any relevant descriptive information provided the user as part of the data element definition, e.g. the label
          and description.
