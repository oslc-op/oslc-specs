# OSLC Configuration Management Read Me

This directory contains the source files for the OSLC Configuration Management Specification,
which is one of the work products of the OASIS OSLC Open Project.

Earlier draft revisions of this specification were work products of the OASIS OSLC Core Technical
Committee, and may be found in the [OASIS OSLC Core TC SVN repo](https://tools.oasis-open.org/version-control/browse/wsvn/oslc-core/trunk/specs/config/).

Even earlier draft revisions of this specification were products of the now-closed Change and
Configuration Management Technical Committee. Those previous drafts may be found in the
[Change and Configuration Management TC SVN repo](https://tools.oasis-open.org/version-control/browse/wsvn/oslc-ccm/tags/final/specs/config-mgt/).

The following files in this directory are part of the specification:

- config-resources.html
- config-shapes.ttl
- config-vocab.html
- config-vocab.ttl
- oslc-config-mgt.html
- versoned-resources.html

The following files are additional material of interest, but not part of the specification.
Some files may become Project Notes or similar documents.

- README.md (this file)
- motivation.html
