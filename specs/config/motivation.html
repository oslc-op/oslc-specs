      <h3>Motivation</h3>
      <p><b>Problem</b></p>
      <p>
        Any software development project team creating anything but the simplest, short-lived solutions knows the value
        of source code management (SCM). Without SCM, teams could not reliably recreate the source files that were used
        to build a specific release, making it impossible to reliably maintain what the team has delivered.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, a large development project involves much more shared information that just source files. Complex
        products and systems are mix of software, electronics, and hardware, with software taking an increasing role.
        Solution components are often developed by different organizations, using different method and tools, with
        lifecycle information stored in different repositories. The design and development of these complex systems
        requires many kinds of artifacts. Engineers in specialist disciplines produce these artifacts employing various
        engineering methods, disciplines and tools. Often these artifacts are not under Configuration Management, or if
        they are, it is done manually with half-measures that incur trade-offs. These challenges exist for software-only
        systems, yet their magnitude is much greater for products with physical, electrical and software aspects.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, specific requirements are often associated with a particular release of components of a system.
        Analysis and design artifacts are created to understand how to address the impact of, or realize those
        requirements. Test cases and test results are used to validate that the work done on the systems actually meets
        the requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        All this shared information is generally not available under the control of a single organization, set of tools
        or content management system, and it is often stored in repositories, not files in the file system. Like source
        files, all this shared information should be managed in a controllable, predictable way that is coordinated with
        specific solution releases.
      </p>
      <p>
        Development teams need an efficient, effective means of managing versions and variants of artifacts across the
        whole systems development lifecycle. They need to be able to capture, preserve, compare, merge and potentially
        recreate specific sets of versioned information covering the whole lifecycle in order to know who did what,
        when, and why.
      </p>
      <p><b>Solution</b></p>
      <p>
        The OSLC Configuration Management specification defines an RDF vocabulary and a set of REST APIs for managing
        versions and configurations of linked data resources from multiple domains. Using client and server applications
        that implement the configuration management vocabulary and REST APIs allow a team administrator to create
        configurations of versioned resources contributed from tools and data sources across the lifecycle. These
        contributions can be assembled into aggregate (<em>global</em>) configurations that are used to resolve
        references to artifacts in a particular and reproducible context.
      </p>
      <p>
        Team members set the configuration context in each of the tools they use to refer to the particular global
        configuration that represents the state of the systems they are working on. They can create branches to support
        parallel development, and compare and merge branches to flow changes as needed. Product managers can create
        branches that represent different variants of a product in order to separate variation points and ensure changes
        are only applied to the appropriate variants.
      </p>
      <p>
        Development teams can create baselines that preserve the state of the federated, shared information in order to
        be able to recreate that state for any reason, including for regulatory compliance or for applying maintenance
        updates to released versions and/or variants of a product.
      </p>
      <p><b>Business Value</b></p>
      <p>
        The primary purpose for versioning and configuration management is to be able to establish and restore or
        recover a particular set of related resources in order to know and manage who changed what, when, and why.
        Applying these techniques to other disciplines, and combining them together, offers new opportunities for
        parallel development, managing change, reuse, and management of product variants in complex development
        projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        The benefits of source-code management are well known. However, achieving those benefits across all of the
        information that goes into designing, building, managing and governing the source code can be a challenge. This
        is because having multiple change and configuration management solutions for different artifact types requires
        manual coordination of versions and variants across the tools. The OSLC Configuration Management specification
        specifies a standard way in which different tools, developed by different suppliers, at different times, using
        different repositories and data representations can contribute version and configuration information across the
        whole lifecycle.
      </p>
      <p>The resulting business value includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cross-tool version and configuration management related shared information</li>
        <li>Support for context-specific link navigation and management</li>
        <li>Automatic configuration management of complex solutions and systems</li>
        <li>
          Enable parallel, independent, development streams with branching and merging of all lifecycle information
        </li>
        <li>
          Save and restore consistent sets of related information for any purpose including regulatory compliance and
          product maintenance releases
        </li>
        <li>Manage different variants of a related set of deliverables, solutions and/or products</li>
        <li>Reuse utilizing commonality/variability for Product Line Engineering (PLE)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Some typical uses of versioning and configuration management capabilities include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Creating baselines of development streams in order to capture and preserve the state of a system at different
          points in time
        </li>
        <li>
          Use release stabilization streams to complete development of specific releases while allowing ongoing future
          development to continue in parallel
        </li>
        <li>
          Branching streams for different purposes including experimentation, A/B testing, gradual production rollout,
          importing from a supplier, etc., and delivering changes on streams to a common shared stream in a controlled
          manner.
        </li>
        <li>
          Parallel development on shared artifacts, overlapping releases or the common parts of product variants with
          the ability to compare different streams and flow changes as needed to meet requirements, enforce enterprise
          asset management and governance, and promote reuse.
        </li>
        <li>
          Create maintenance branches and control propagation of maintenance changes into ongoing development streams in
          a controlled, predictable manner
        </li>
        <li>Managing configurations of related, federated, shared information across the whole lifecycle.</li>
        <li>
          Isolate changes for different variants on different streams while also managing common, reusable components.
        </li>
        <li>
          Enable reuse of lifecycle artifacts including requirements and test cases, as well as the relationships
          between them, including regulatory and security requirements and test cases.
        </li>
        <li>
          Enable analysts and designers to work one iteration ahead in agile projects in order to better inform
          iteration planning and development.
        </li>
        <li>
          Enable progressive contribution of parts of a large system with baselines that capture each significant
          evolution of the system.
        </li>
        <li>
          Support different approaches to reuse by branching from product streams that are closes to the new variant, or
          branching from a common base that is maintained as a reusable enterprise asset.
        </li>
        <li>
          Enable concurrent development of shared enterprise assets in different product delivery streams (requirements
          delivery life-cycles) while at the same time managing and governing changes to long-lived enterprise assets
          (asset management life-cycles).
        </li>
