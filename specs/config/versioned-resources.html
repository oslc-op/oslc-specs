      <h2>Concept and Version Resources</h2>
      <p>
        This part of the OSLC Configuration Management Specification defines the representation and behavior of
        versioned resources - resources that have multiple versions.
      </p>
      <p>
        As described in
        <a href="oslc-config-mgt.html#concepts"
          >OSLC Configuration Management - Concept resources, version resources, and configuration contexts</a
        >, the major &ldquo;Artifacts&rdquo; or &ldquo;Entities&rdquo; in OSLC domains are
        <strong><em>concept resources</em></strong
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        The state (including the properties) of a concept resource can vary over time, or for other reasons. A
        <strong><em>versioned resource</em></strong> is a concept resource that keeps track of different states; a
        <strong><em>version resource</em></strong> is one specific state of a versioned resource.
      </p>
      <p>
        Versioned resources are typically used in configurations - where they are often called
        <em>configuration items</em>.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="version-resources">
      <h2>Version Resources</h2>
      <p class="conformance">
        A version resource defines a particular version of the state of a concept resource. Not every past state is
        necessarily kept. A server MAY elide or discard states.
      </p>
      <p>
        A version resource URI identifies a specific version of a concept resource with no further configuration context
        required.
      </p>
      <p class="conformance">A version resource MUST have a type of <code>oslc_config:VersionResource</code>.</p>
      <p class="conformance">
        A version resource MUST be related to its concept resource using the <code>dcterms:isVersionOf</code> property.
      </p>
      <p class="conformance">Version resources SHOULD be compliant with [[!LDP]].</p>
      <p class="conformance">Version resources SHOULD have an <code>oslc_config:versionId</code> property.</p>
      <p class="conformance">
        Servers MAY provide other properties that distinguish between major changes or revisions, and minor changes or
        iterations.

        <li>HEAD: Retrieve information about a specific version resource.</li>
        <li>GET: Retrieve the state of a specific version resource.</li>

      <ul>
        <li class="conformance">
          PUT: Update the state of a specific version resource; this operation MAY succeed by creating a new version, or
          MAY succeed without creating a new version for servers that offer version resources with mutable state. A PUT
          operation on a version resource MAY fail, since version resources may be immutable, or have many immutable
          properties.
        </li>
        <li class="conformance">
          DELETE: Delete the specified version resource. Deletion of immutable versions, or versions used in
          configurations, MAY fail or MAY require specific privileges.

    <section id="vdelegateduis">
      <h2>Delegated UIs</h2>
      <p class="conformance">
        A versioned resource server MAY provide delegated user interface dialogs for creation of new concept resources
        or new version resources.
      </p>
      <p class="conformance">
        A versioned resource server SHOULD provide delegated user interface dialogs for selection of concept resources.
        A versioned resource server MAY provide delegated user interface dialogs for selection of version resources, but
        such selection is typically performed in a configuration context to find the appropriate version.

    <section id="vcompact">
      <h2>Compact Rendering</h2>
      <p class="conformance">
        A versioned resource server SHOULD implement compact rendering, both for concept resources and version
        resources. See <a href="config-resources.html#compact">Compact Rendering</a> for the handling of configuration
        context in such rendering.

      <h2>Tracked Resource Sets</h2>

        A versioned resource server MAY publish version resources in a Tracked Resource Set; the URIs in the base and
        change log MUST be the version resource URIs, not the concept resource URIs. All Tracked Resource Sets for
        version resources MUST be compliant with [[!TRS]].
