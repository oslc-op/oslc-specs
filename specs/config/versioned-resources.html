      <h2>Concept and Version Resources</h2>
      <p>
        This part of the OSLC Configuration Management Specification defines the representation and behavior of
        versioned resources - resources that have multiple versions.
      </p>
      <p>
        As described in
        <a href="oslc-config-mgt.html#concepts"
          >OSLC Configuration Management - Concept resources, version resources, and configuration contexts</a
        >, the major &ldquo;Artifacts&rdquo; or &ldquo;Entities&rdquo; in OSLC domains are
        <strong><em>concept resources</em></strong
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        The state (including the properties) of a concept resource can vary over time, or for other reasons. A
        <strong><em>versioned resource</em></strong> is a concept resource that keeps track of different states; a
        <strong><em>version resource</em></strong> is one specific state of a versioned resource.
      </p>
      <p>
        Versioned resources are typically used in configurations - where they are often called
        <em>configuration items</em>.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="version-resources">
      <h2>Version Resources</h2>
      <p class="conformance">
        A version resource defines a particular version of the state of a concept resource. Not every past state is
        necessarily kept. A server MAY elide or discard states.
      </p>
      <p>
        A version resource URI identifies a specific version of a concept resource with no further configuration context
        required.
      </p>
      <p class="conformance">A version resource MUST have a type of <code>oslc_config:VersionResource</code>.</p>
      <p class="conformance">
        A version resource MUST be related to its concept resource using the <code>dcterms:isVersionOf</code> property.
      </p>
      <p class="conformance">
        Version resources SHOULD be compliant with the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/">Linked Data Platform 1.0</a>.
      </p>
      <p class="conformance">Version resources SHOULD have an <code>oslc_config:versionId</code> property.</p>
      <p class="conformance">
        Servers MAY provide other properties that distinguish between major changes or revisions, and minor changes or
        iterations.
      </p>

    <section id="vitemoperations">
      <h2>Supported Operations on Versioned Resources</h2>
      <p class="conformance">A versioned resource server MUST support the following operations on version resources:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>HEAD: Retrieve information about a specific version resource.</li>
        <li>GET: Retrieve the state of a specific version resource.</li>
        <li>OPTIONS: Get information about the available operations on a version resource.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="conformance">A versioned resource server MAY support the following operations on version resources:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="conformance">
          PUT: Update the state of a specific version resource; this operation MAY succeed by creating a new version, or
          MAY succeed without creating a new version for servers that offer version resources with mutable state. A PUT
          operation on a version resource MAY fail, since version resources may be immutable, or have many immutable
          properties.
        </li>
        <li class="conformance">
          DELETE: Delete the specified version resource. Deletion of immutable versions, or versions used in
          configurations, MAY fail or MAY require specific privileges.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="vdelegateduis">
      <h2>Delegated UIs</h2>
      <p class="conformance">
        A versioned resource server MAY provide delegated user interface dialogs for creation of new concept resources
        or new version resources.
      </p>
      <p class="conformance">
        A versioned resource server SHOULD provide delegated user interface dialogs for selection of concept resources.
        A versioned resource server MAY provide delegated user interface dialogs for selection of version resources, but
        such selection is typically performed in a configuration context to find the appropriate version.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="vcompact">
      <h2>Compact Rendering</h2>
      <p class="conformance">
        A versioned resource server SHOULD implement compact rendering, both for concept resources and version
        resources. See <a href="config-resources.html#compact">Compact Rendering</a> for the handling of configuration
        context in such rendering.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="vtrs">
      <h2>Tracked Resource Sets</h2>
      <p class="conformance">
        A versioned resource server MAY publish version resources in a Tracked Resource Set; the URIs in the base and
        change log MUST be the version resource URIs, not the concept resource URIs. All Tracked Resource Sets for
        version resources MUST be compliant with [[!TRS]], and servers providing such Tracked Resource Sets SHOULD
        follow the guidance in [[!ILDP]].
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="conformance">
      <h2>Conformance</h2>
      <p class="conformance">
        This specification is based on [[!OSLCCore3]]. OSLC Configuration Management Servers servers MUST be compliant
        with the Core specification, MUST follow all the mandatory requirements in the normative sections of each part
        of this specification, and SHOULD follow all the guidelines and recommendations in both these specifications.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following table summarizes the conformance requirements in this document; review the conformance tables or
        paragraphs in the other parts of this specification for a complete list.
