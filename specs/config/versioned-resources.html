<h2>Concept and Version Resources</h2>
  <p>This part of the OSLC Configuration Management Specification defines the representation and behavior of versioned resources - resources that have multiple versions.</p>
  <p>As described in <a href="oslc-config-mgt.html#concepts">OSLC Configuration Management - Concept resources, version resources, and configuration contexts</a>,
  the major &ldquo;Artifacts&rdquo; or &ldquo;Entities&rdquo; in OSLC domains are <strong><em>concept resources</em></strong>.</p>
  <p>The state (including the properties) of a concept resource can vary over time, or for other reasons.
    A <strong><em>versioned resource</em></strong> is a concept resource that keeps track of different states;
    a <strong><em>version resource</em></strong> is one specific state of a versioned resource.</p>
  <p>Versioned resources are typically used in configurations -
    where they are often called <em>configuration items</em>.</p>
</section>
<section id="version-resources">
<h2>Version Resources</h2>
  <p>A version resource defines a particular version of the state of a concept resource.
    Not every past state is necessarily kept. A server MAY elide or discard states.</p>
  <p>A version resource URI identifies a specific version of a concept resource with no further configuration context required.</p>
  <p>A version resource MUST have a type of <code>oslc_config:VersionResource</code>.</p>
  <p>A version resource MUST be related to its concept resource using the <code>dcterms:isVersionOf</code> property.</p>
  <p>Version resources SHOULD be compliant with the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/">Linked Data Platform 1.0</a>.</p>
  <p>Version resources SHOULD have an <code>oslc_config:versionId</code> property.</p>
  <p>Servers MAY provide other properties that distinguish between major changes or revisions,
    and minor changes or iterations.</p>

<section id="vitemoperations">
  <h2>Supported Operations on Versioned Resources</h2>
  <p>A versioned resource server MUST support the following operations on version resources:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>HEAD: Retrieve information about a specific version resource.</li>
    <li>GET: Retrieve the state of a specific version resource.</li>
    <li>OPTIONS: Get information about the available operations on a version resource.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A versioned resource server MAY support the following operations on version resources:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>PUT: Update the state of a specific version resource;
    this operation MAY succeed by creating a new version,
    or MAY succeed without creating a new version
    for servers that offer version resources with mutable state.
    A PUT operation on a version resource MAY fail, since version resources may be immutable, or have many immutable properties.</li>
    <li>DELETE: Delete the specified version resource.
    Deletion of immutable versions, or versions used in configurations, MAY fail or MAY require specific privileges.</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section id="vdelegateduis">
  <h2>Delegated UIs</h2>
  <p>A versioned resource server MAY provide delegated user interface dialogs for creation of new concept resources or new version resources.</p>
  <p>A versioned resource server SHOULD provide delegated user interface dialogs for selection of concept resources.
  A versioned resource server MAY provide delegated user interface dialogs for selection of version resources, but such selection is typically performed in a configuration context to find the appropriate version.</p>
</section>
<section id="vcompact">
  <h2>Compact Rendering</h2>
  <p>A versioned resource server SHOULD implement compact rendering, both for concept resources and version resources.
    See <a href="config-resources.html#compact">Compact Rendering</a> for the handling of configuration context in such rendering.</p>
</section>
<section id="vtrs">
  <h2>Tracked Resource Sets</h2>
  <p>A versioned resource server MAY publish version resources in a Tracked Resource Set;
  the URIs in the base and change log MUST be the version resource URIs, not the concept resource URIs.
  All Tracked Resource Sets for version resources MUST be compliant with [[!TRS]],
  and servers providing such Tracked Resource Sets SHOULD follow the guidance in [[!ILDP]].</p>
