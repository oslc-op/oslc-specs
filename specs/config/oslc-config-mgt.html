      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The specification:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>defines RDF representations of configurations and versioned resources</li>
        <li>defines methods for creation, updating, and deletion of aggregate (<em>global</em>) configurations</li>
        <li>
          defines how a version of a given resource is identified within the context of a configuration (global or
          local)
        </li>
        <li>defines how configurations local to a tool or domain contribute to a global configuration</li>
        <li>
          recommends but does not mandate creation, updating, and deletion of configurations local to a tool or domain
        </li>
        <li>
          allows but does not mandate capabilities for creation, deletion, and other management of versions of resources
          other than configurations themselves.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        While the scope of this specification does not include all of [[ITIL]] or [[ITSM]], a configuration as defined
        by this specification shall be able to contain or reference a set of Configuration Items (CIs) and their
        specific versions, and hence participate in the Identification, Control, and Monitoring activities of ITIL.

        <h3>Terminology</h3>
        <dl class="spaced">
          <dt><dfn>Baseline</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
            An immutable configuration of one or more components that corresponds to some meaningful state of its
            resources. The set of configuration items in a baseline cannot be changed; the state of each of those items
            cannot be changed. Some of the metadata on the baseline itself can be changed, such as tags, comments, etc.
            Baselines are useful for recording deliverables, enabling a team to work with a known configuration, or as
            an initial state for some new stream of work.
          </dd>
          <dt><dfn>Branch</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
            (<em>verb</em>) to create a configuration for parallel or insulated development.<br />
            (<em>noun</em>) the result of parallel or insulated development after branching - that is, a sequence of
            baselines, usually with a stream at the end of the branch.
          </dd>
          <dt><dfn>Change Set</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
            A change set is a related set of changes, introducing new versions of resources, grouped together to ensure
            coherence and consistency. In some systems, a change set may be treated as a configuration that contains a
            delta to some other configuration; this standard allows but does not require change sets to be represented
            as configurations.
          </dd>
          <dt><dfn>Component</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
            A unit of organization consisting of a set of version resources. For a particular versioned resource,
            different versions can be in different components. Components are the units of configurability, and form
            reusable assets or building blocks. The granularity of a component varies between servers, but typically it
            contains the set of resources used in some product, project, or a subdivision of such a set. The resources
            in a component may be of any type, or multiple types, including but not limited to types defined in various
            OSLC domain specifications.
          </dd>
          <dt><dfn>Concept Resource</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
            An artifact (a requirement, test case, source code file, etc.) as an overall entity, independent of any
            specific version of that artifact. In Product Line Management (PLM) systems, this is often referred to as a
            'master' item or part, of which there are revisions and versions or iterations.
          </dd>
          <dt><dfn>Configuration</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
            A configuration identifies a set of versions of resources in a component. In some systems, those resources
            are called configuration items. Configurations commonly identify exactly one version of each resource in a
            component. Configurations can also aggregate other configurations ('contributions'), identifying further
            sets of versions of resources in other components, thus assembling a shared context across multiple
            components.
          </dd>
          <dt><dfn>Configuration Item</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
            A configuration item is a resource selected in a configuration - that is, it is a versioned resource. See
            <a href="#dfn-version">version</a>.
          </dd>
          <dt><dfn>Container</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
            A Linked Data Platform Container, often abbreviated to
            <em><strong>LDPC</strong></em
            >, as defined in [[LDP]].
          </dd>
          <dt><dfn>Contribution</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
            A configuration that is a member of the set of configurations making up a configuration. The set of
            versioned resources in a configuration is the union of the set of versioned resources in that configuration
            and all its contributions; contributions are ordered to resolve any conflicts between that set.
          </dd>
          <dt><dfn>Global Configuration</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
            A configuration that identifies a set of configurations contributed by multiple tools or configuration
            management servers, allowing you to define all the relevant resources for a system. Using global
            configurations, you can establish a configuration context across multiple tools, even when each tool stores
            its resources in otherwise unrelated configurations and repositories.
          </dd>
          <dt><dfn>Revision</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
            In PLM systems, changes to an item are often divided into more significant changes marked as new revisions,
            and less significant changes marked as versions or iterations within the same revision. The boundary between
            revisions is often marked by a state change, such as marking the last version within a revision as
            'released'. This specification does not require such a distinction between major and minor changes, using
            the generic term 'version' for both revision and version or iteration, but does not prohibit systems from
            providing the distinction.
          </dd>
          <dt><dfn>Selections</dfn></dt>
          <dd>The set of versions of resources identified by a given configuration.</dd>
          <dt><dfn>Stream</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
            A modifiable configuration of resources. For example, team members deliver to a stream when they want to
            make their changes visible to other team members. In many systems, changes to versioned resources can only
            be made in a stream.
          </dd>
          <dt><dfn>Tag</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
            A short string used to find, mark, qualify, or identify some resource. Resources can have multiple tags.
            Tags can be used to indicate the intended purpose of a resource, or to flag it for some intention.
          </dd>
          <dt><dfn>Variant</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
            This term is not used formally by the specifications, but informally it may refer to a version of a resource
            that is identified by a specific set of characteristics that distinguish it from other versions of that
            resource, where each variant can exist at the same time as those other versions of the resource.
          </dd>
          <dt><dfn>Version</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
            A referenceable state of a resource. A resource with separable referenceable versions is called a
            <em><strong>versioned resource</strong></em
            >. Each version of such a resource is called a <em><strong>version resource</strong></em
            >, and can be referenced with a distinct URI. In PLM systems, versions are often subdivided into revisions
            and versions or iterations.

      <section id="concepts" class="informative">
        <h3>Concept resources, version resources, and configuration context</h3>
        <p>
          All the major &ldquo;Artifacts&rdquo; or &ldquo;Entities&rdquo; in OSLC domains are
          <strong><em>concept resources</em></strong
          >. Examples are defects, tasks, products, physical parts or items, projects, users, tests cases requirements,
          plans and so on. Like all resources, concept resources have URLs. Except in a few technical and specialized
          scenarios, URLs of concept resources are used throughout the system. &ldquo;Entities&rdquo; are addressed in
          HTTP messages via their concept resource URLs. Links are typically established using the URL of a concept
          resource.
        </p>
        <p>
          The state (including the properties) of a concept resource can vary over time, or for other reasons. A
          <strong><em>versioned resource</em></strong> is a concept resource that keeps track of different states. a
          <strong><em>version resource</em></strong> is a resource that represents one specific state of a versioned
          resource. Not every past state is necessarily kept; a server may elide or discard states that are no longer
          referenced.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not all resource types need be versioned - for example, OSLC change requests are typically not versioned. OSLC
          configurations and components need not be versioned.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a versioned resource, a GET on the URI of a concept resource normally resolves that URI to an appropriate
          state of (version of) that concept resource for the appropriate configuration context (see later). The
          returned http resource will contain RDF statements about both the version resource and the concept resource;
          most statements should use the concept resource as the subject, because a version resource reflects the state
          of (properties of) the concept resource as it appeared at some time. Using the concept resource URI as the
          subject of RDF statements is more consistent with the handling of non-versioned resources; using the versioned
          resource URI as the subject of RDF statements requires more client knowledge of versioning.
        </p>
        <p>
          For some PLM or PLE applications, it is useful to be able to represent incomplete or abstract hierarchies as
          partially-bound configurations, where not all versions of the concepts in that configuration have yet been
          determined. That determination may be made later in time, or dynamically based on parameters defined elsewhere
          in the system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since different versions reflecting different states of the concept resource may return conflicting RDF
          statements about the same subject, it is important for clients handling multiple versions (multiple
          configurations) to keep track of the relevant versions; this can be done using RDF named graphs.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an example, <code>GET https://example.com/conceptResourceA</code> in one configuration context might
          return:
        </p>
        <pre class="example">
:conceptResourceA-version23
    a oslc_config:VersionResource ;
    dcterms:isVersionOf :conceptResourceA . # dcterms:isVersionOf relates the version resource itself to its concept resource
:conceptResourceA
    a :someType ;
    oslc_config:versionId &quot;23&quot; ;
    dcterms:title &quot;Concept Resource A&quot; ;
    :color &quot;blue&quot; ;
    dcterms:description &quot;Concept resource A as it appears in the state with the URI :conceptResourceA-version23&quot; .</pre
        >
        <p>while in a different configuration context it might return:</p>
        <pre class="example">
:conceptResourceA-version17
    a oslc_config:VersionResource ;
    dcterms:isVersionOf :conceptResourceA .
:conceptResourceA
    a :someType ;
    oslc_config:versionId &quot;17&quot; ;
    dcterms:title &quot;Concept Resource A&quot; ;
    :color &quot;red&quot; ;
    dcterms:description &quot;Concept resource A as it appears in the state with the URI :conceptResourceA-version17&quot; .</pre
        >
        <p>
          To keep track of which version represented which state of the conflicting color statements, use of RDF named
          graphs is recommended, as shown here using [[TriG]]:
        </p>
        <pre class="example">
:conceptResourceA-version23 = {
    :conceptResourceA-version23
        a oslc_config:VersionResource ;
        dcterms:isVersionOf :conceptResourceA .
    :conceptResourceA
        a :someType ;
        oslc_config:versionId &quot;23&quot; ;
        dcterms:title &quot;Concept Resource A&quot; ;
        :color &quot;blue&quot; ;
        dcterms:description &quot;Concept resource A as it appears in the state with the URI :conceptResourceA-version23&quot; .
}.

:conceptResourceA-version17 = {
    :conceptResourceA-version17
        a oslc_config:VersionResource ;
        dcterms:isVersionOf :conceptResourceA .
    :conceptResourceA
        a :someType ;
        oslc_config:versionId &quot;17&quot; ;
        dcterms:title &quot;Concept Resource A&quot; ;
        :color &quot;red&quot; ;
        dcterms:description &quot;Concept resource A as it appears in the state with the URI :conceptResourceA-version17&quot; .
}.</pre
        >
        <p>
          Updating a versioned resource is typically performed in a stream, and usually results in the creation of a new
          version of the same concept resource. In some systems, a related batch of changes to one or more resources can
          be grouped into a <em>change set</em>; this version of OSLC Configuration Management does not define how
          change sets might work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since concept resource URIs for versioned resources do not inherently identify a specific version of that
          resource, a client needs to provide a configuration context within which the concept resource is resolved to a
          specific version.
        </p>
        <p>
          A client requests a specific configuration context in a
          <a href="config-resources.html#configcontext">header or a query string</a>.
