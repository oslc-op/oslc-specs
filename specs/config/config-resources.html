      <h4>Configuration context</h4>
      <p>
        Since concept resource URIs for versioned resources do not inherently identify a specific version of that
        resource,
        <span class="conformance"
          >a client SHOULD provide a configuration context within which the concept resource is resolved to a specific
          version</span
        >.
      </p>
      <p>A client requests a specific configuration context in one of two ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          When performing a GET on a concept URI, add a <code>Configuration-Context</code> header, passing the URI of a
          configuration resource as the value.
          <pre class="example">
GET /resources/conceptResourceA HTTP/1.1
Configuration-Context: https://example.com/configurations/myConfiguration1</pre
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          When performing a GET on a concept URI, add a query string <code>oslc_config.context</code> and the encoded
          configuration URI to the end of the request URI:
          <pre class="example">
GET /resources/conceptResourceA?oslc_config.context=%3Chttp%3A//example.com/configurations/myConfiguration1%3E HTTP/1.1</pre
          >
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="conformance">
        <p>
          The <code>Configuration-Context</code> header is a URI that MUST conform to the following ABNF grammar
          [[!ABNF]]:
        </p>

        <pre>
        SP = " "
        HTAB = %x09
        WSP = SP / HTAB

        header = config-context
        config-context = "Configuration-Context:" *WSP URI
        </pre>
        <p>Where the term <code>URI</code> is defined in [[!URI]].</p>
      </div>
      <p>Syntax of the query string for configuration context:</p>
      <pre class="indent">?oslc_config.context=<em>uri_ref_esc</em></pre>
      <p>
        The <em>uri_ref_esc</em> is an angle bracket-delimited URI reference in which &gt; and \ are \-escaped, as
        defined in [[!OSLCCore3]].
      </p>
      <p class="conformance">A server MUST support both these methods of passing configuration context.</p>
      <p class="conformance">
        If a request contains both a header and a query string, the server MUST use the query string. Servers MUST
        reject requests that contain two or more different configuration contexts passed in query strings.
      </p>
      <p class="conformance">
        Where the <code>Configuration-Context</code> header is used on a request, a server SHOULD include in the
        response a header <code>Vary=Configuration-Context</code> so that different configuration contexts do not use a
        previously cached response.
      </p>
      <p class="conformance">
        Configuration Management servers SHOULD use the <code>Access-Control-Allow-Headers</code> header [[!CORS]] to
        allow the use of the <code>Configuration-Context</code> header in OSLC requests.
      </p>
      <p class="conformance">
        A request SHOULD contain only a single occurrence of the <code>Configuration-Context</code> header, and MUST NOT
        contain multiple <code>Configuration-Context</code> headers referencing different values. A server SHOULD treat
        multiple identical <code>Configuration-Context</code> headers as it would a single header, and MUST treat
        multiple <code>Configuration-Context</code> headers with different configuration values as an error.
      </p>
      <p class="conformance">
        If a configuration context is passed on a request for a non-versioned resource, the server MUST NOT treat that
        as an error, and MAY use that context to resolve references to embedded or related resources.
      </p>
      <p class="conformance">
        If a configuration context is passed on a request using the version URI for a versioned resource, a server MUST
        ignore the configuration context, even if that configuration context does not select that versioned resource.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        The client is responsible for providing the correct configuration context to each request issued by that client
        at least where the relevant resource might be a versioned resource. If a resource returned from such a request
        contains links, the client should not assume the server has returned version-specific or configuration-specific
        links, and the client should continue to provide the correct configuration context to fetch those related
        resources. Only in cases where the client knows that a resource is not versioned may the configuration context
        be omitted. As noted later, the <a href="#compact">compact rendering</a> returned for UI Previews is an
        exception to this rule.
      </p>
      <p class="note" title="Implicitly defined configuration contexts">
        While navigating between resources, resources or links of certain types may indicate that a different context is
        to be used when following links from that resource. Any such semantics should be defined by the specifications
        for such resource and link types; none are defined by this specification.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h4>Default configuration</h4>
        <p class="conformance">
          If a configuration context is not provided or implied, the server MAY provide a default configuration, or the
          request MAY fail.
        </p>
        <p class="conformance">
          A server MAY include an <code>oslc_config:configurationSettings</code> link in the OSLC Service resource,
          referencing an <code>oslc_config:ConfigurationsSettings</code> resource. That resource MAY contain at most one
          <code>oslc_config:defaultConfiguration</code> property whose value is the URI of the default configuration to
          be used by that service.
        </p>
        <p class="conformance">
          An <code>oslc_config:defaultConfiguration</code> property with an <code>rdf:nil</code> value implies there is
          no default configuration, so requests with no context MUST fail.
        </p>
        <p class="conformance">
          Servers MAY support a PUT on <code>oslc_config:ConfigurationsSettings</code> resource as a way to set the
          default configuration. Servers MAY provide other ways for users to set the default configuration.
        </p>

        <p class="note" title="Default configuration may be implicit">
          The absence of the <code>oslc_config:defaultConfiguration</code> has no implication as to the presence or
          absence of a default configuration.

      <h2>Change Sets</h2>
      <p>
        Some systems use change sets to group related changes, or changes to multiple resources that must be kept
        together. Change sets MAY be represented using a configuration of type <code>oslc_config:ChangeSet</code> - a
        special type of stream. Each <code>oslc_config:ChangeSet</code> resource is related to exactly one base
        configuration (either a stream or a baseline), using the <code>oslc_config:overrides</code> property. A
        <code>oslc_config:ChangeSet</code> has either a complete set of replacements for the versions selected by that
        base configuration, or a set of changes - a delta. The configuration defined by a change set thus identifies
        both the 'before' state (the base configuration that is overridden by this change set), and the 'after' state
        defined by the change set configuration itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Systems that allow multiple change sets to be applied to a single base configuration SHOULD represent each such
        internal change set as an <code>oslc_config:ChangeSet</code> resource using the same value of
        <code>oslc_config:overrides</code>; the property <code>prov:wasDerivedFrom</code> should be used to provide a
        complete or partial ordering of such change sets. Servers MAY also synthesize a combined
        <code>oslc_config:ChangeSet</code> resource representing the overall effect of multiple internal change sets.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a change set is based on a stream (the <code>oslc_config:overrides</code> property on an instance of an
        <code>oslc_config:ChangeSet</code> refers to a configuration of type <code>oslc_config:Stream</code>), then the
        'before' state is mutable, and may not represent the state at the time the change set was created. Servers can
        avoid this lack of precision by ensuring either that all changes made to a stream are captured in a change set
        based off that stream, or that the stream's <code>oslc_config:selections</code> properties accurately represent
        the sets of changes delivered to that stream before any of the change sets based on that stream (those change
        sets probably representing changes still pending for the stream).
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the shape for a change set allows only a single value for <code>oslc_config:overrides</code>, systems that
        allow a single change set to be applied to multiple base configurations need to represent that internal change
        set by multiple <code>oslc_config:ChangeSet</code> resources. These copies MAY be associated with each other
        using properties such as <code>http://purl.org/datanode/ns#isCopyOf</code>, <code>dcterms:relation</code>, or
        similar.

      <h2>Matching Contributions</h2>
      <p>
        Certain types of streams accept only certain other types of configurations as contributions.

          >A global stream MUST accept any suitable configuration (baseline or stream) from an arbitrary configuration
          server</span
        >, while a stream from some non-global server might accept only configurations from the same server. For a

        non-global configurations are valid only as a contribution to a broader scoped stream from that same server.
      </p>
      <p>
        The acceptability of a configuration as a child contribution to a parent stream is governed by the
        <code>oslc_config:acceptedBy</code> property on the child configuration and the
        <code>oslc_config:accepts</code> property on the parent stream. A configuration is a match, and thus acceptable
        as a contribution, if and only if:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The parent has an <code>oslc_config:accepts</code> property whose value matches one of the types of the child

      <p>
        A configuration type matches another type if they are the same type, or if the parent type is
        <code>oslc_config:Configuration</code> and the child type is either <code>oslc_config:Baseline</code> or
        <code>oslc_config:Stream</code>. No other form of inference is required, but

      <p>
        Since baselines are immutable, their contributions (if any) are immutable, derived from the streams from which
        those baselines were created, so the <code>oslc_config:accepts</code> property is not meaningful and may be
