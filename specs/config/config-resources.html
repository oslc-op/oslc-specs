      <h4>Configuration context</h4>
      <p>
        Since concept resource URIs for versioned resources do not inherently identify a specific version of that
        resource,
        <span class="conformance"
          >a client SHOULD provide a configuration context within which the concept resource is resolved to a specific
          version</span
        >.
      </p>
      <p>A client requests a specific configuration context in one of two ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          When performing a GET on a concept URI, add a <code>Configuration-Context</code> header, passing the URI of a
          configuration resource as the value.
          <pre class="example">
GET /resources/conceptResourceA HTTP/1.1
Configuration-Context: https://example.com/configurations/myConfiguration1</pre
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          When performing a GET on a concept URI, add a query string <code>oslc_config.context</code> and the encoded
          configuration URI to the end of the request URI:
          <pre class="example">
GET /resources/conceptResourceA?oslc_config.context=%3Chttp%3A//example.com/configurations/myConfiguration1%3E HTTP/1.1</pre
          >
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>TBD - define syntax of Configuration-Context header by referring to IETF RFC.</p>
      <p>Syntax of the query string for configuration context:</p>
      <pre class="indent">?oslc_config.context=<em>uri_ref_esc</em></pre>
      <p>
        The <em>uri_ref_esc</em> is an angle bracket-delimited URI reference in which &gt; and \ are \-escaped, as
        defined in [[!OSLCCore3]].
      </p>
      <p class="conformance">A server MUST support both these methods of passing configuration context.</p>
      <p class="conformance">
        If a request contains both a header and a query string, the server MUST use the query string. Servers MUST
        reject requests that contain two or more different configuration contexts passed in query strings.
      </p>
      <p class="conformance">
        Where the <code>Configuration-Context</code> header is used on a request, a server SHOULD include in the
        response a header <code>Vary=Configuration-Context</code> so that different configuration contexts do not use a
        previously cached response.
      </p>
      <p class="conformance">
        A request SHOULD contain only a single occurrence of the <code>Configuration-Context</code> header, and MUST NOT
        contain multiple <code>Configuration-Context</code> headers referencing different values. A server SHOULD treat
        multiple identical <code>Configuration-Context</code> headers as it would a single header, and MUST treat
        multiple <code>Configuration-Context</code> headers with different configuration values as an error.
      </p>
      <p class="conformance">
        If a configuration context is passed on a request for a non-versioned resource, the server MUST NOT treat that
        as an error, and MAY use that context to resolve references to embedded or related resources.
      </p>
      <p class="conformance">
        If a configuration context is passed on a request using the version URI for a versioned resource, a server MUST ignore
        the configuration context, even if that configuration context does not select that versioned resource.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        The client is responsible for providing the correct configuration context to each request issued by that client
        at least where the relevant resource might be a versioned resource. If a resource returned from such a request
        contains links, the client should not assume the server has returned version-specific or configuration-specific
        links, and the client should continue to provide the correct configuration context to fetch those related
        resources. Only in cases where the client knows that a resource is not versioned may the configuration context
        be omitted. As noted later, the <a href="#compact">compact rendering</a> returned for UI Previews is an
        exception to this rule.
      </p>
      <p class="note" title="Implicitly defined configuration contexts">
        While navigating between resources, resources or links of certain types may indicate that a different context is
        to be used when following links from that resource. Any such semantics should be defined by the specifications
        for such resource and link types; none are defined by this specification.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h4>Default configuration</h4>
        <p class="conformance">
          If a configuration context is not provided or implied, the server MAY provide a default configuration, or the
          request MAY fail.
        </p>
        <p class="conformance">
          A server MAY include an <code>oslc_config:configurationSettings</code> link in the OSLC Service resource,
          referencing an <code>oslc_config:ConfigurationsSettings</code> resource. That resource MAY contain at most one
          <code>oslc_config:defaultConfiguration</code> property whose value is the URI of the default configuration to
          be used by that service.
        </p>
        <p class="conformance">
          An <code>oslc_config:defaultConfiguration</code> property with an <code>rdf:nil</code> value implies there is
          no default configuration, so requests with no context MUST fail.
        </p>
        <p class="conformance">
          Servers MAY support a PUT on <code>oslc_config:ConfigurationsSettings</code> resource as a way to set the
          default configuration. Servers MAY provide other ways for users to set the default configuration.
        </p>

        <p class="note" title="Default configuration may be implicit">
          The absence of the <code>oslc_config:defaultConfiguration</code> has no implication as to the presence or
          absence of a default configuration.

      <h2>Change Sets</h2>
      <p>
        Some systems use change sets to group related changes, or changes to multiple resources that must be kept
        together. Change sets may be represented using a configuration of type <code>oslc_config:ChangeSet</code> - a
        special type of stream. Each <code>oslc_config:ChangeSet</code> resource is related to exactly one base
        configuration (either a stream or a baseline), using the <code>oslc_config:overrides</code> property. A
        <code>oslc_config:ChangeSet</code> has either a complete set of replacements for the versions selected by that
        base configuration, or a set of changes - a delta. The configuration defined by a change set thus identifies
        both the 'before' state (the base configuration that is overridden by this change set), and the 'after' state
        defined by the change set configuration itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Systems that allow multiple change sets to be applied to a single base configuration should represent each such
        internal change set as an <code>oslc_config:ChangeSet</code> resource using the same value of
        <code>oslc_config:overrides</code>; the property <code>prov:wasDerivedFrom</code> should be used to provide a
        complete or partial ordering of such change sets. Servers may also synthesize a combined
        <code>oslc_config:ChangeSet</code> resource representing the overall effect of multiple internal change sets.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a change set is based on a stream (the <code>oslc_config:overrides</code> property on an instance of an
        <code>oslc_config:ChangeSet</code> refers to a configuration of type <code>oslc_config:Stream</code>), then the
        'before' state is mutable, and may not represent the state at the time the change set was created. Servers can
        avoid this lack of precision by ensuring either that all changes made to a stream are captured in a change set
        based off that stream, or that the stream's <code>oslc_config:selections</code> properties accurately represent
        the sets of changes delivered to that stream before any of the change sets based on that stream (those change
        sets probably representing changes still pending for the stream).
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the shape for a change set allows only a single value for <code>oslc_config:overrides</code>, systems that
        allow a single change set to be applied to multiple base configurations need to represent that internal change
        set by multiple <code>oslc_config:ChangeSet</code> resources. These copies may be associated with each other
        using properties such as <code>http://purl.org/datanode/ns#isCopyOf</code>, <code>dcterms:relation</code>, or
        similar.

        The acceptability of a configuration as a child contribution to a parent stream is governed by the

      <h2>Long Operations</h2>
      <p>
        Some operations (for example, creating a baseline from a large hierarchy of streams) can take a long time to
        complete.
      </p>

      <p class="conformance">
        Servers MAY use the standard HTTP response 202 Request Accepted to indicate that a request has been accepted,
        but may not yet be complete.
      </p>
      <p class="conformance">
        The content and location header of this 202 response MUST be that of an
        <code>oslc_config:Activity</code> resource, indicating the progress or result of that activity. Clients SHOULD
        poll the Activity resource periodically until the state indicates it has finished.
      </p>
      <p class="conformance">
        Each Activity resource MUST be persisted by a server (including over a restart) for a minimum of 24 hours after
        completion of the long operation as a whole, or until explicitly deleted by a client.
      </p>
      <p class="conformance">
        Clients SHOULD delete each Activity created by a long-running operation soon after the client has seen the
        completion of the activity, or when the client is no longer interested in the result. Servers MAY deny clients
        access to delete Activity resources including but not limited to activities still in progress, or activities not
        created by that client, or MAY require clients to have a specific role or permission to delete activities.
