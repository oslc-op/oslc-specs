      This directory contains the source files for the OSLC Configuration Management Specification, which is one of the
      work products of the OASIS OSLC Open Project.

      Earlier draft revisions of this specification were work products of the OASIS OSLC Core Technical Committee, and
      may be found

      Even earlier draft revisions of this specification were products of the now-closed Change and Configuration
      Management Technical Committee. Those previous drafts may be found
