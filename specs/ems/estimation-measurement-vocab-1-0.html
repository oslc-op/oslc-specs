    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>This specification defines a vocabulary and resource shapes for common
      estimation-measurement resources. The intent is to define resources needed to
      support common integration scenarios and not to provide a comprehensive
      definition of a Change Request. The resource formats may not match exactly
      the native models supported by change management service providers, but are
      intended to be compatible with them. The approach to supporting these
      scenarios is to delegate operations, as driven by service provider
      contributed user interfaces, as much as possible and not require a service
      provider to expose its complete data model and application logic.</p>

    <h2>EMS 1.0 REST API Standard URIs</h2>

    <section id="standardURIs-Introduction">
      <h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>

      <p>Many of the resources defined in the EMS 1.0 data model have properties that refer to formats, metrics, units
        of measure, dimensions, and grains. We model these property values as resources themselves, and identify them
        using URIs. This use of URIs to identify resources is consistent with the underlying RDF data model of EMS 1.0
        and enables the unambiguous interchange of information among multiple service providers and consumers.</p>

      <p>This specification defines standard URIs for many of these key resources. Other organizations MAY define
        additional standard URIs. Users of EMS 1.0 SHOULD use standard URIs where they are applicable, but MAY use other
        URIs when no standard ones exists.</p>

      <p>This specification defines a standard <em>classification</em> scheme for these key resources as well as
        assigning them standard URIs. The classification scheme consists of a set of <em>classes</em> with
        <em>subclass</em> relationships among them. Each class is also assigned a standard URI. A set of related
        classes, subclasses, and individuals is sometimes referred to as an <em>ontology</em>.</p>

        <p>A <em>format</em> is a specification of the syntax of a resource. In EMS 1.0, the value of the <a
            href="https://archive.open-services.net/bin/view/Main/MetricsEmsWorkBreakdownStructure.html#ems_wbsFormat">ems:wbsFormat</a>
          property
          is a format resource. <a href="#ems_Format">ems:Format</a> is the class of all formats and <a
            href="#ems_WbsFormat">ems:WbsFormat</a> is the subclass of all WBS formats.</p>

      </section>

      <section id="ems_Metric">

        <h4 id="ems_Metric">ems:Metric</h4>

        <p>A <em>metric</em> is a procedure or algorithm for quantifying or measuring some aspect of a thing, system,
          event, etc. In EMS 1.0, we are concerned with metrics for software development projects. For example, duration
          is the metric that measures the amount of time that a project takes. <a href="#ems_Metric">ems:Metric</a> is
          the class of all metrics.</p>

        <p>A metric may be either directly measured or it may be computed from other metrics. Metrics that are computed
          from other metrics are referred to as <em>derived</em> metrics.</p>

        <p>In general, a project is a time-bounded work effort that produces a unique result. <em>Time</em> (<a
            href="#ems_TimeMetric">ems:TimeMetric</a>) and <em>effort</em> (<a
            href="#ems_EffortMetric">ems:EffortMetric</a>) are therefore key metrics that apply to any project. For
          software development projects, the result produced is new or enhanced source code that provides some desirable
          capabilites. <em>Size</em> metrics (<a href="#ems_SizeMetric">ems:SizeMetric</a>) quantify the capability,
          scope, or bulk of the software. <em>Reliability</em> metrics (<a
            href="#ems_Reliability">ems:ReliabilityMetric</a>) quantify the correctness of the software.
          <em>Productivity</em> metrics (<a href="#ems_ProductivityMetric">ems:ProductivityMetric</a>) quantify the
          amount of time or effort required to produce the software. Time, effort, size, reliability, and productivity
          are <em>core</em> metrics for software development projects.</p>

        <p>People produce software using <em>processes</em> and <em>practices</em>, e.g. automatic unit testing,
          continuous integration, etc. It is often useful to monitor metrics that quantify these processes. For example,
          the test execution success/fail rates is a useful metric for the quality management processes.
          <em>Process</em> metrics (<a href="#ems_ProcessMetric">ems:ProcessMetric</a>) quantify the processes and
          practices used by the development team.</p>

        <p><em>Cost</em> is a key metric to track for any project. In software projects, labor is usually the main cost
          component so there is a close relationship between cost and effort. However, there are other cost components,
          and other financial metrics, such as <em>benefit</em> and <em>value</em>. We therefore group all of these
          <em>financial</em> metrics into a separate class (<a href="#ems_FinancialMetric">ems:FinancialMetric</a>).</p>

        <p>See <a href="https://archive.open-services.net/bin/view/Main/MetricsEMS10RestApiKeySoftwareMetrics.html">Key
            Software Metrics</a> for
          more detail.</p>

      </section>

      <section id="ems_UnitOfMeasure">

        <h4 id="ems_UnitOfMeasure">ems_UnitOfMeasure</h4>

        <p>The value of a measurement of a metric is expressible as a real number with respect to some <em>unit of
            measure</em>. For example, project duration is typically measured in units of months or years. <a
            href="#ems_UnitOfMeasure">ems:UnitOfMeasure</a> is the class of all units of measure.</p>

        <p>We slightly abuse the term <em>unit of measure</em> since in general it includes both a unit of measure and
          an origin from which measurements are made. For example, temperature is often measured in units from some
          value designed as zero degrees, and calendar dates are measured from some starting time.<p>The value of a
            measurement of a metric is expressible as a real number with respect to some <em>unit of measure</em>. For
            example, project duration is typically measured in units of months or years. <a
              href="#ems_UnitOfMeasure">ems:UnitOfMeasure</a> is the class of all units of measure.

      </section>

      <section id="ems_Dimension">

        <h4 id="ems_Dimension">ems:Dimension</h4>

        <p>A project metric is often an aggregate quantity that is built up from more detailed metrics. For example, the
          total effort for a project is the sum of the effort spent in each time period of the project. Here effort is
          said to be analyzed along the <em>dimension</em> of time. A metric may be simultaneously analyzed along more
          than one dimension. For example, effort is often analyzed along both time and role dimensions. <a
            href="#ems_Dimension">ems:Dimension</a> is the class of all dimensions</p>

      </section>

      <section id="ems.3ADimensionMember">

        <h4 id="ems.3ADimensionMember">ems:DimensionMember</h4>

        <p>A dimension <em>member</em> is any subset, interval, or region of a dimension. In the example of the time
          dimension, any specific day, week, month, year, etc., such as the day 1970-01-01, is a member.
          ems:DimensionMember is the class of all dimension members.</p>

      </section>

      <section id="ems_Grain">

        <h4 id="ems_Grain">ems:Grain</h4>

        <p>The level of detail used to analyze a metric along some dimension is referred to as the <em>grain</em> of the
          dimension. A grain is a set of dimension members that are mutually exclusive and that together span the entire
          dimension. For example, if we measure effort per month then we are analyzing effort along the time dirmension
          using a grain size of one month. A dimension may have more than one grain. For example, time may be analyzed
          by day, month, week, month, year, etc. <a href="#ems_Grain">ems:Grain</a> is the class of all grains.</p>

        <p>One grains <em>refines</em> another is every member of the coarser grain is equal to a union of some members
          of the finer grain. For example, days refine weeks, however, weeks do not refine months since some weeks begin
          and end in different months. The refinement relation between grains defines a natural hierarchy.</p>

    <section id="QUDT">

      <h3 id="QUDT">QUDT</h3>

      <p>NASA has published the [[!QUDT]] ontology for Quantities, Units, Dimensions, and Data
        Types. This ontology contains standard URIs for time (<a
          href="http://www.qudt.org/qudt/owl/1.0.0/qudt/index.html#TimeUnit">qudt:TimeUnit</a>) and currency (<a
          href="http://www.qudt.org/qudt/owl/1.0.0/qudt/index.html#CurrencyUnit">qudt:CurrencyUnit</a>) units. We will
        use these rather than defining new ones here.</p>

      <p>The class <a href="http://www.qudt.org/qudt/owl/1.0.0/qudt/index.html#Unit">qudt:Unit</a> describes units of
        measure. We therefore define <a href="#ems_UnitOfMeasure">ems:UnitOfMeasure</a> to be a superclass of qudt:Unit,
        i.e. any instance of qudt:Unit is also an instance of ems:UnitOfMeasure .<p>NASA has published the QUDT ontology
          for <a href="http://www.qudt.org/">Quantities, Units, Dimensions, and Data Types</a>. This ontology contains
          standard URIs for time (<a
            href="http://www.qudt.org/qudt/owl/1.0.0/qudt/index.html#TimeUnit">qudt:TimeUnit</a>) and currency (<a
            href="http://www.qudt.org/qudt/owl/1.0.0/qudt/index.html#CurrencyUnit">qudt:CurrencyUnit</a>) units. We will
          use these rather than defining new ones here.</p>

      <p>The class <a href="http://www.qudt.org/qudt/owl/1.0.0/qudt/index.html#QuantityKind">qudt:QuantityKind</a>
        corresponds closely to <a href="#ems_Metric">ems:Metric</a>.</p>

      <p>We could therefore use the QUDT ontology to provide machine-readable information about the metrics and units of
        measure defined in this specification. One advantage of doing this is that <a
          href="http://www.qudt.org/qudt/owl/1.0.0/qudt/index.html#Unit">qudt:Unit</a> has properties that give the
        conversion factors for transforming between compatible units of measure, i.e. units of measure that apply to the
        same quantity kinds such as months and years applying to duration. Since the set of metrics and units of
        measures is open, other organizations that define new metrics and units of measure could also describe them
        using QUDT and thereby enable automatic conversions between the new and existing units. An EMS 1.0 service

      <p>ems:TimeMetric is the class of all time metrics. It is a subclass of ems:Metric. Time metrics quantify both
        when events occur and how much time passes between two events. These two types of time metric are closely
        related but different. Here we use the term <em>event</em> to mean some instant that marks a point in time, but
        that itself occupies no duration. The length of time that passes between two project events is typically
        measured in hours, days, weeks, etc.</p>

      <p>The point in time at which an event occurs is measured with reference to some calendar that establishes an
        origin point in time. For example, in the Gregorian calendar, points in time are measured as the amount of time
        that has elapsed since a certain historical event that is denoted as year 1 AD. Points in <a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">Unix time</a> as measured as the elapsed time since the
        so-called <em>epoch</em> which has the Gregorian date 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.</p>

        <p>A project is a time-bounded work effort, and the work on a project is performed by people. At any given point
          in time during the project, some number of people will be working on it. This number varies over the course of
          the project. metric:staffing is the average number of people working on a project. This metric is typically
          broken down by role, time, and task dimensions. A staffing curve for a project is simply the metric:Staffing
          metric broken down along the time dimension.</p>

        <p>metric:PeakStaffing is the maximum number of people that work on a project. Like metric:Staffing, it can be

          employees. In this case, the ems:Staffing metric does not give a completely accurate picture of the staffing
          level. Full-time equivalent (FTE) provides a count of the number of people weighted by their level of
          assignment to the project. For example, 10 half-time people count as 5 FTE people. ems:FullTimeEquivalent
          measures the average number of FTE people that are working and like ems:sfaffing, is tyically broken down by

          metric:IFPUG42_FunctionPoints is defined by International Function Point User Group (IFPUG), <a
            href="http://www.ifpug.org/publications/manual.htm">The Function Point Standard, Counting Practices Manual,
            Release 4.2</a>. This metric is typically broken down along the feature dimension.</p>

        <p>A test case is an artifact that describes how to test some aspect of a software system. A test case specifies
          a sequence of inputs or actions, and their expected outputs or results. The number of test cases, the rate at
          which they are produced, and the coverage of the software system by test cases are useful metrics.</p>

        <p>A test execution is a process that runs a test case on a software system. Test executions may be manual or
          automated, and may succeed or fail. A test execution is successful if the system system produces the expected
          result for the test case. The percentage and frequency of successful test executions is an indicator of
          project health, and may be used as an exit criterion for the testing phase.</p>

      <p>A dimension is an attribute that can be used to analyse a metric. Metrics are typically computed by aggregating
        project events and so any attribute of those events may be a useful way to analyse the metric.</p>

      <p>For example, consider the peak staffing metric. It is computed by counting the number of people working on the
        project during each time period and taking the maximum of those counts. Peak staffing can therefore be analyzed
        by time. Furthermore, the count of all people could be broken down by their role, so peak staffing could also be
        analysed by role. In general, any metric may be analysed along several dimensions.</p>

      <p>In general, zero or more dimensions may be applicable to any given metric, and a given dimension may be
        applicable to zero or more metrics. The following table lists standard URIs for the key dimensions:</p>

      <p>The Constructive Cost Model
        [[!COCOMO]] is a software estimation model defined by <a
          href="http://sunset.usc.edu/Research_Group/barry.html">Dr.
          Barry Boehm</a>. The current version is referred to as COCOMO II.</p>

      <p>The COCOMO II model computes project effort and duration from size. It contains several main parameters known
        as A, B, C, D, E, F, SF, and EM which are defined in the <a
          href="http://csse.usc.edu/csse/TECHRPTS/2000/usccse2000-500/usccse2000-500.pdf">COCOMO II Model Definition
          Manual Version 2.1</a>. SF is called the scale factor and EM is called the effort multiplier. Since these
        parameters are used to compute effort and duration from size, they are productivity metrics for the project.</p>

      <p>This model is of more general interest since it provides an analysis of the scale and cost drivers that
        influence SF and EM. SF can therefore be broken down along the scale driver dimension and EM can be broken down
        along the cost driver dimension. The model defines one grain size for the scale driver dimension and it contains
        five scale drivers. The model defines two grains for the cost driver dimension. There is one cost driver grain
        for use in the early design stage and it contains seven cost drivers. There is a second, more detailed grain
        size for the post-architecture phase and it contains seventeen cost drivers.</p>

      <p>Scale drivers only apply to the project as a whole, as does the required development schedule (SCED) cost
        driver. The other cost drivers may be further broken down by component of the system being developed.</p>
