  <section id="What-is-an-OSLC-Service">
    <h2>What is an OSLC Service?</h2>

    <p>At OSLC we use the term <em>service</em> in an informal way, on the assumption that members of this community
      have a general understanding of the term and that no confusion will arise in the absence of a formal. However, the
      EMS 1.0 uses service in a specific way so it is useful to define it here. The !W3C definition of a <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ws-arch/#whatis">Web service</a> gives us a starting point, but we need to modify
      that to incorporate the OSLC choice of REST as the architectural style and software development lifecycle
      collaboration as the domain. We therefore use the following working definition of service within the context of
      the EMS 1.0 specification:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>An OSLC service is a <a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer#RESTful_web_services">RESTful</a> software
        system designed to support interoperable lifecycle tool collaboration over the Web.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Since this definition states that an OSLC service is RESTful, we know that it must manage a set of resources that
      can be accessed via standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. Sound software design principles
      tell us that a service should have good internal cohesion in the sense that the resources it manages should be
      closely related to each other and together serve some useful purpose. For example, if there are certain relations
      or data integrity constraints that must hold among resources, then it may make sense to manage those resources
      together in a single service. The scope of EMS 1.0 is restricted to resources that describe the estimation and
      measurement aspects of software projects.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, if resources are fairly decoupled, then they should be managed by distinct services. For
      example, we would expect there to be distinct services for each domain of software development projects, e.g.
      portfolio management, project management, performance management, requirements management, change management,
      quality management, etc. In general a service may collaborate with many other services and applications. The REST
      API of each service defines the collaboration contract. This leads us to a view of larger systems being composed
      from webs of related OSLC services.</p>

    <h2>EMS 1.0 REST API Architecture</h2>

    <section id="REST-API-Architecture-Introduction">
      <h3>Introduction</h3>

      <p>This specification defines a REST API that provides estimation and measurement capabilities. Web applications
        may either implement or use these interfaces. We refer to an implementation of these interfaces as a <em>service
          provider</em> and user of these interfaces as a <em>service consumer</em>.</p>

      <p>In practice, PPM and software estimation tools may be either service consumers or providers. That decision is
        up to the tool architect. For example, a desktop-based tool may be a consumer while a server-based tool may be
        either a consumer or a provider.</p>

    </section>

    <section id="The-EM-Service">
      <h3>The EM Service</h3>

      <p>In order to separate tool architecture concerns from the specification of the EMS 1.0 REST API, it is useful to
        imagine that a standalone Web application is the service provider. We will refer to such an application simply
        as an <em>EM service</em>. The following diagram illustrates the context of an EM service:</p>

        <figcaption>Fig. <span class="figno">1</span> <span class="fig-title">EM Service Context Diagram</span>

      </figure>

    </section>

    <section id="Packaging-the-EM-Service-with-Products">
      <h3>Packaging the EM Service with Products</h3>

      <p>The above diagram treats all collaboratoring tools on an equal footing with respect to the EM service and the
        EMS 1.0 REST API is described from the point of view of the EM service. However, as noted above, it is likely
        that the EM service would be included as part of a more comprehensive product, either integrated with a single
        tool or shared among a suite of related tools. For example, the following context diagram illustrates a software
        estimation product that includes an EM service:</p>

      <figure id="Software-Estimation-Product-Context-Diagram">
        <img src="images/software-estimation-product-context-diagram.png">

            Diagram</span>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

    </section>

    <section id="Tool-Collaborations">
      <h3>Tool Collaborations</h3>

      <p>The following discussion briefly illustartes how PPM and software estimation tools might use an EM service to
        collaborate.</p>

      <p>The portfolio management tool initiates projects. A portfolio manager creates the project proposal, which
        includes all relevant project contraints such as size, duration, or peak staffing, sends them to the EM service,
        and requests an estimate. The software estimator receives this request, launches the software estimation tool,
        produces an estimate, sends it back to the EM service, and notifies the portfolio manager. The portfolio manager
        then gets estimate from the EM service, completes the project business case, and submits the project proposal to
        the approval process. The EM service maintains a persistent record of the project proposal and estimates for
        future use. If the project gets approved, the portfolio management system hands off the project to the project
        management system.</p>

      <p>The project management tool plans, monitors, and controls projects. As the project executes, measurements are
        collected by the performance management tool. The project manager runs reports from the performance management
        tool that show the measurements relative to the estimates. If the measurements vary too much from the estimates,
        the project manager takes corrective action. Periodically, the project manager sends revised project constraints
        to the EM service and requests the software estimator to reestimate the project to completion, taking into
        account the measurements to date. The new estimates become part of the project baseline and the project manager
        continues on to the next phase of the project.</p>

      <p>The performance management tool collects measurements from the software development and PPM tools, and provides
        a business intelligence user interface for managers and other team members to view and explore the data, e.g. to
        diagnose problems. The performance management tool also collects estimates from the EM service so that the
        measurements can be compared to the estimates. The performance management system can display dashboards,
        scorecards, control charts, and other presentations of the data to allow team members to track the performance
        of the project. The performance management tool also provides measurements to the EM service to enable both
        reestimation of project plans and calibration of software estimation models based on past completed projects.
      </p>

      <p>The software estimation tools get project contraints and measurements from the EM service, and send it
        estimates. Software estimation tools are used for calibrating models, providing initial cost estimates and
        plans, and reestimating project plans.</p>

      <p>In practice, performance management tools use Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) processes to collect data. A REST
        API can act as a source of data for ETL, and the EM service will provide a REST API that is suitable for use by
        ETL processes, mainly so that the performance management tool can load the estimates and make them available for
        use in reports. Performance management tools provide reporting mechanisms for accessing data. In principle, any
        application could access measurement data directly from the performance management tool through its reporting
        interface, however that approach would result in a replication of business logic. A better approach is to use
        the EM service as a proxy to the performance management tool.</p>

      <p>Given the above considerations, software estimation, portfolio management, and project management tools will be
        read-write consumers of the EM service, but the performance management tool will be a read-only consumer. The EM
        system will be a consumer of the performance management tool’s native reporting interface in order to access
        measurements.</p>

    <h2>EMS 1.0 REST API Design</h2>

    <section id="REST-API-Design-Introduction">
      <h3>Introduction</h3>

      <p>The following sections discuss the general design principles used in this specification.</p>

    </section>

    <section id="Implementation-Dependent-Features">
      <h3>Implementation-Dependent Features</h3>

      <p>Before discussing the design further, it is appropriate to define the scope of this specification by listing
        those general features of a service that are not specified here.</p>

      <h4 id="Authentication">Authentication</h4>

      <p>This specification does not define an authentification mechanism. Service providers SHOULD support some
        authentication mechansim but are free to support a variety of authentication mechanisms. However, in order to
        ensure interoperability with a broad set of other applications, some standard mechanism such as [[!OAuth]]
        SHOULD be supported.</p>

      <h4 id="Authorization-and-Access-Control">Authorization and Access Control</h4>

      <p>This specification does not define an authorization mechanism. Service providers SHOULD support some
        authorization mechanism to control access to resources and the operations that service consumers may perform on
        them.</p>

      <h4 id="Work-Flow-and-Policy-Enforcement">Work Flow and Policy Enforcement</h4>

      <p>This specification does not define a work flow or policy enforcement mechanism. Service providers SHOULD
        support some mechanism to enforce work flow and policy.</p>

      <h4 id="Revision-History-and-Auditing">Revision History and Auditing</h4>

      <p>This specification does not define a revision history or auditing mechanism. Service providers SHOULD provide
        support for recording the revision history of all resources including their states, the timestamp of the change,
        and the identity of the entity making the change.</p>

      <h4 id="Events-and-Notification">Events and Notification</h4>

      <p>This specification does not define an event or notification mechanism. Service providers SHOULD support Atom
        format as a resource representation to enable change monitoring by feed readers.</p>

    </section>

    <section id="The-Role-of-RDF">
      <h3>The Role of RDF</h3>

      <p>This specification describes the EMS 1.0 resource data model using [[!RDF]].
        Briefly, the RDF data model describes information as statements of the form (subject, predicate, object) which
        are often referred to as triples. The predicate of a statement either describes a relation between the subject
        and object resources or an attribute of the subject resource whose value is the object.</p>

      <p>The choice of RDF for this purpose, instead of other equally valid approaches such as UML or
        Entity-Relationship, is motivated by the goal of aligning the data model with Web architectural principles. This
        use of RDF in no way implies any restriction on how EM services or clients are implemented. We expect tool
        developers to be able to add support for the EMS 1.0 REST API to existing tools without any need to rewrite
        those tools using RDF-based techologies.</p>

      <p>This specification also defines RDF/XML representations for resources. In general, there are many equivalent
        ways to serialize a set of RDF triples as RDF/XML. This specification prescribes the way to serialize resources
        as RDF/XML so that these representations are well-formed XML and may be processed with any of the many available
        XML processing technologies (e.g. DOM, SAX, !StAX, XSLT, XQuery, etc.). There is no requirement to use a general
        RDF/XML parser.</p>

      <p>The RDF/XML representation is used in examples. However, EM services should support other important formats
        such as JSON and HTML, as may support other RDF formats, e.g. [[!N3]] and [[!Turtle]].</p>

      <p>An EM client SHOULD use standard HTTP content negotiation to indicate a preference for specific formats.</p>

    <section id="Resource-Types">
      <h3>Resource Types</h3>

      <p>An EM service manages access to resources that support the estimation and measurement <a
          href="https://archive.open-services.net/wiki/estimation-and-measurement/Software-Estimation-Use-Cases/index.html"
          title="Software-Estimation-Use-Cases">uses cases</a>. The
        EM service manages the creation, retrieval, update, and deletion of these resources, and maintains their mutual
        data integrity constraints in the process of doing so.</p>

      <p>The EMS 1.0 data model defines several resource types. The data model for each resource type and the data
        integrity constraints that hold among resources are defined in detail later in this specification. Each EMS 1.0
        resource type is identified by a URI that begins with the following URI:</p>

      <pre><code>http://open-services.net/ns/ems# 
      </code></pre>

      <p>Througout this specification, we use the prefix ems: to abbreviate this URI. For example, ems:Service is an
        abbreviation for the following URI:</p>

      <pre><code>http://open-services.net/ns/ems#Service
      </code></pre>

      <p>EMS 1.0 defines three kinds of resource type, namely domain entities, domain entity lists, and the service
        root. The domain entity resource types are ems:Project, ems:Scenario, ems:Estimate, ems:Baseline, and
        ems:Measurement. For each domain entity type, there is an associated list type, i.e. ems:ProjectList,
        ems:ScenarioList, ems:EstimateList, ems:BaselineList, and ems:MeasurementList. Finally, the ems:Service resource
        type represents the EM service as a whole.</p>

      <p>An EM service contains information about a set of resources of the above types. We will use RDF to describe
        this information. In RDF terms, the information forms a graph. Each resource is a node in this graph and each
        triple is an arc in it.</p>

      <p>The EM service graph may contain zero or more instances of each domain entity resource type. EM clients may
        create and delete instances using the REST API. The graph also contains exactly one instance of each associate
        entity list type and exactly one instance of the service root type. The list and service resources are built-in
        to the EM service. EM clients may not create or delete the list or service root resources.</p>

    </section>

    <section id="Resource-Properties">
      <h3>Resource Properties</h3>

      <p>Each resource type has a set of properties which will be described in detail later in this specification. Some
        of these properties are automatically maintained by the EM service and may not be modified by EM clients. We
        refer to these as read-only properties. Some read-only properties such as creation date, creator, etc. are
        system properties that apply to all resources. Other read-only properties, such as list membership, are specific
        to a given resource type. For example, when a new domain entity resource is created, a membership property that
        references it is added to its associated list resource.</p>

      <p>We refer to properties that may be directly set or modified by EM clients as read-write properties.</p>

    </section>

    <section id="HTTP-Methods">
      <h3>HTTP Methods</h3>

      <p>The REST API supports the usual HTTP methods: GET, PUT, POST, DELETE. In addition, query parameters MAY be
        appended to resource URLs in order to modify the response of a GET request. The syntax of these query parameters
        is specified in <a href="https://archive.open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OslcSimpleQuerySyntaxV1.html">OSLC
          Simple Query Syntax V1</a>.
      </p>

      <p>An EM client may retrieve a representation any resource using GET and may modify its read-write properties
        using PUT. A representation of information about any resource, possibly including information about related
        resources, may be retrieved using GET with query parameters that specify the properties to include.</p>

      <p>An EM client may create a new domain entity resource by POSTing a representation of it to its associated list
        resource. Any domain entity resource may be deleted using DELETE.</p>

      <p>A domain entity list resource contains membership links to each of its associated domain entity resources. An
        EM client may retrieve a representation that contains a subset of these membership links, and specified
        properties of the referenced domain entity resources via GET with query parameters. We refer to this as “GET
        sublist” in the table below.</p>

      <p>The following table summarizes the HTTP methods used in the REST API:</p>

      <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">

      <p>This specification defines RDF/XML representations for all resource types. An EM service MUST support RDF/XML

    </section>

    <section id="Distributed-Computing">
      <h3>Distributed Computing</h3>

      <p>Any domain entity resource is either an ems:Project resource or is related to a unique ems:Project resource.
        For example, each ems:Scenario resource has exactly one ems:project property that links it to a unique
        ems:Project resource, and each ems:Estimate resource has exactly one ems:scenario property that links it to a
        unique ems:Scenario resource, therefore each ems:Estimate resource is related to a unique ems:Project resource.
        Similarly, ems:Baseline and ems:Measurement resources are related to unique ems:Project resources.</p>

      <p>This specification defines behavior in the simple case where all domain entity resources that are related to a
        given ems:Project resource are managed by the same service. This is a simplifying assumption and affects how
        resources are discovered and baselined. For example, to find all the estimates for a given project, a query is
        run on the ems:EstimateList resource that is linked to the same ems:Service resource that is linked to the
        ems:ProjectList resource that contains the ems:Project resource. Also, when an ems:Baseline resource is created,
        the service automatically updates the ems:currentBaseline property of the related ems:Project resource.</p>

      <p>While it is certainly possible to define a fully distributed REST API for coordinating queries and updates
        across a group of collaborating EMS service providers, doing so for a 1.0 specification would add a premature
        level of complexity and cost for implementers.</p>

      <p>As more products add support for the EMS 1.0 REST API, it is anticipated that there may be more than EMS 1.0
        service provider in a given deployment. An EMS 1.0 service consumer may interact with multiple EMS 1.0 service
        providers. This causes no difficulty as long as all the resources related to a project are created in the same
        service provider instance.</p>

      <p>In order to build in an evolution path towards a fully distributed REST API, this specification will adopt that
        policy of specifying that resources related to a given project or intermediate resource SHOULD be created in the
        same service. If the project or intermediate resource is in a different service then the behavior is undefined.
        If there is sufficient demand for a fully distributed REST API, then a future EMS specification will define this
        behavior.</p>

  <section id="REST-API-Data-Model">
    <h2>EMS 1.0 REST API Data Model</h2>

    <section id="REST-API-Design-Introduction">
      <h3>Introduction</h3>

      <p>The data model consists of a set of resource types and literal XML datatypes. Each resource type is described
        by listing and describing its properties. Each resource type and literal XML datatype is described in detail
        below.</p>

    </section>

    <section id="Properties">
      <h3>Properties</h3>

      <p>Each property is described by specifying its range, its occurrence, and its edit type.</p>

      <h4 id="Range">Range</h4>

      <p>The range of a property is the set of objects that may appear in statements (triples) that have the given
        property as their predicate. In this specification, the range of each property is either a set of resources of
        some RDF type, or a set of literal values that belong to some XML datatype, e.g. strings, numbers, XHTML
        fragments.</p>

      <p>When the range is a resource, the value of the property is frequently a URI that is a link to the resource. In
        RDF/XML, the URI value is given using the rdf:resource attribute on the property element.</p>

      <p>However, some resources do not have document URIs and are represented inline in some parent resource
        representation. Within an RDF/XML representation, an inline resource MAY be identified using the rdf:ID
        attribute on its node element, and be the object of other properties using the rdf:resource attribute on the
        property element. The value of the rdf:ID attribute MUST be unique within the RDF/XML representation. If the
        resource is local, then it does not have any URI, i.e. it is a blank node in the RDF data model. Within an
        RDF/XML representation, a blank node may be identified and referenced using the rdf:nodeID attribute.</p>

      <p>The following table summarizes how resources are represented in RDF/XML:</p>

      <h6 id="Table-of-Resource-Ranges">Table of Resource Ranges</h6>

      <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">

        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>resource</td>
            <td>The property element has an rdf:resource attribute that contains the URI of the resource.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>inline resource</td>
            <td>The property element contains a node element for the resource. The node element has an rdf:about or
              rdf:ID attribute that contains the URI of the resource.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>local resource</td>
            <td>The property element has an rdf:nodeID attribute that contains the local identifier of the resource. The
              local identifer MUST be defined on some node element within the representation.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>local inline resource</td>
            <td>The property element contains a node element for the resource. The node element MAY have an rdf:nodeID
              attribute that defines its local identifier.</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h5 id="XHTML">XHTML</h5>

      <p>We use [[!XHTML]] to describe formatted textual literal XML datatypes. In
        this specification, the prefix xhtml: is associated with the XHTML namespace URI:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p><code>http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</code></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>For example, the datatype xhtml:span means the XHTML content that may appear in an xhtml:span element.</p>

      <h5 id="XML-Schema">XML Schema</h5>

      <p>We use <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/">XML Schema Datatypes</a> to describe some literal XML
        datatypes. In this specification, the prefix xsd: is associated with the XML Schema namespace URI:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p><code>http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema</code></p>
      </blockquote>

      <h4 id="Occurrence">Occurrence</h4>

      <p>The occurrence of a property is the number of triples that may exist for a given subject with the given
        property as the predicate. Properties may be either optional (may not occur) or mandatory (must occur), and may
        be either single-valued (at most once) or multi-valued (an unbounded number of times). We use the following
        terms to describe the most common occurrence constraints:</p>

      <h6 id="Table-of-Occurrence-Names">Table of Occurrence Names</h6>

      <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
        <thead>

            <td>one-or-more</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h4 id="Edit-Type">Edit Type</h4>

      <p>The edit type of a property specifies how it may be directly modified by a service consumer.</p>

      <p>Some properties may be freely modified. These are called read-write properties.</p>

      <p>Some properties may only be modified once, e.g. at resource creation time. These are called write-once
        properties.</p>

      <p>Finally, some properties may not be modified driectly because they are either generated or maintained by the EM
        service. These are called read-only properties. For example, creation date is a read-only property.</p>

      <p>The following table summarizes the edit types:</p>

        For example, ems:{Entity}List stands for ems:ProjectList, ems:ScenarioList, etc.</p>

      <p>The string {entity} stands for a domain entity name with an initial lowercase letter. For example,

      <p>The ems:service property links each domain entity list to its service root. The service root contains links to
        all of its domain entity lists. Therefore, given any domain entity list URL, a consumer can navigate from it to
        the service root, and from there to all the other domain entity lists.</p>

      <p>This read-only property is automatically maintained by the service. It cannot be modified.</p>

      <h4 id="ems.3AmemberEntity">ems:member{Entity}</h4>

      <p>The ems:member{Entity} property is a membership property that links each domain entity list to all of its
        member domain entities. Each domain entities has a link back to its domain entity list. Therefore, given any
        domain entity URL a consumer can navigate from it to its domain entity list, and from there to all the other
        domain entities in the list.</p>

      <p>This read-only property is automatically maintained by the service. When a new domain entity is POSTed to a
        domain entity list, the service automatically adds an ems:member{Entity} property that links to it. When the
        domain entity is DELETEd, the service removes the link to it.</p>

      <h3>Metric Entities</h3>

      <p>A metric entity is a resource that represents some aspect of a project that can be measured or estimated.
        Metric entities are assumed in scenarios, predicted in estimates, and observed in measurements.</p>

      <p>A measure is a simple metric entity that consists of a single value such as the total cost of a project.</p>

      <p>Measures may be organized into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact_table">fact tables</a> that analyze
        the composition of the measures along dimensions such as time and role.</p>

      <p>Some dimension values, such as role, may have standard values. A map resource lets you describe how custom
        dimension values have been mapped to standard values.</p>

      <p>Measures and fact tables may be either definite values that result from observations, or <a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution">probability distributions</a> that occur in
        assumptions or predictions.</p>

      <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_breakdown_structure">Work breakdown structures</a> are a common

      <h3>Probability Distributions</h3>

      <p>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution">probability distribution</a> is a resource
        that defines the likelihood that a measurement of some value (a random variable) will fall within some given
        range. Probability distributions are used in scenario assumptions and estimate predictions.</p>

      <p>The use of probability distributions to describe measurements of individual metrics (i,e. univariate
        probability distributions) is a simplification that discards information about how the individual metrics are
        correlated with each other. A software development project is a single, complex, entity and therefore
        measurements of different metrics are not in general independent.</p>

      <p>For example, consider effort broken down by labor role. An estimate would give probability distributions for
        the amounts of coding and testing effort. A high measurement of coding effort and a low measurement of testing
        effort might both be within acceptable control limits. However, in practice we expect more code to require more
        testing, i.e. the coding and testing effort measurements should be correlated. Correlation information can be
        represented by multivariate probability distributions, however they are not currently included in the EMS 1.0
        specification. If an estimate gave a multivariate probability distribution for effort by role, then a high
        measurement for coding combined with a low measurement for testing might fall outside the control limits and
        alert the project manager to a potential problem. Multivariate probability distributions therefore have
        potential value and should be considered in</p>

      <p>There are several commonly occuring probability distributions, such as the triangular and normal distributions.
        Any probablility distribution may be approximated by its quantile function for a sufficiently large number of
        quantiles.</p>

      <h4 id="ems.3AProbabilityDistribution">ems:ProbabilityDistribution</h4>

      <p>ems:ProbabilityDistribution denotes the abstract class of all probability distribution resources. This
        specification defines several concrete subclasses of probability distribution resources.</p>
