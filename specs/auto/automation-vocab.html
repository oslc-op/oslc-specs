      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        This specification defines vocabulary terms for OSLC Automation resources. The intent is to define resources
        needed to support common integration scenarios that require potentially long running services that manage other
        OSLC resources.
      </p>

      <section id="terminology" class="informative">
        <h2>Terminology</h2>
        <p>
          Terminology is based on OSLC Core Overview [[!OSLCCore3]], W3C Linked Data Platform [[!LDP]], W3C's
          Architecture of the World Wide Web [[WEBARCH]], Hyper-text Transfer Protocol [[!HTTP11]]. Terminology for this
          specification is defined in part 1 of the multi-part specification.

          In addition to the namespace URIs and namespace prefixes <code>oslc</code>, <code>rdf</code>,
          <code>dcterms</code> and <code>foaf</code> defined in the

          namespace prefix of <code>oslc_am</code>
        </p>

        <p>This specification also uses these namespace prefix definitions:</p>

          <li>oslc_rm : <code>http://open-services.net/ns/rm#</code> [[OSLCRM]]</li>

      <h2>Automation Vocabulary Terms</h2>
      <p>
        This specification defines the <em>root</em> superclasses, properties and values. Servers may define additional
        subclasses and provide additional properties as needed.

    <section id="resourceDefinitions">
      <h2>Automation Resource Definitions</h2>

      <p>
        The Automation resource properties are not limited to the ones defined in this specification; service providers
        may provide additional properties. It is recommended that any additional properties exist in their own unique
        namespace and not use the namespaces defined in this specification.
      </p>

      <p>
        A list of properties is defined for each type of resource. Most of these properties are identified in
        [[!OSLCCore3]] Any exceptions are noted. Relationship properties refer to other resources. These resources may
        be in any OSLC domain (including Automation).
      </p>

      <p>The diagram below shows the relationships between Automation Resources.</p>

      <p>
        <img
          alt="Diagram of OSLC Automation relationships"
          src="http://open-services.net/pub/Main/AutoSpecificationV1/oslc_automation_resources.png"
        />
      </p>

      <p>
        For all resource types defined in this specification, all required properties (those defined with an occurrence
        of exactly-one or one-or-many) MUST exist for each resource and must be provided when requested. All other
        properties are optional, and might not exist on some or any resources; those that do not exist will not be
        present in the returned representation even if requested, while those that do exist MUST be provided if
        requested. Providers MAY define additional provider-specific properties; providers SHOULD use their own
        namespaces for such properties, or use standard Dublin Core or RDF namespaces and properties where appropriate.
      </p>

      <p>
        If no specific set of properties is requested, all properties are returned - both those defined in this
        specification as well as any provider-specific ones. See [[!OSLCCore2]] Selective Property Values in OSLC Core
        Specification.
      </p>

      <p>
        Consumers of OSLC Automation services should note that some resources may have a very large number of related
        resources, and that some resources may be very large and/or expensive to compute. For this reason, consumers are
        strongly encouraged to use the <code>oslc.properties</code> parameter to limit the properties returned from a
        request to the subset required. See [[!OSLCCore2]] Selective Property Values in OSLC Core Specification.

    <section id="relationshipLabels" class="informative">
      <h3>Relationship labels</h3>
      <p>
        When an RM relationship property is to be presented in a user interface, it may be helpful to provide an
        informative and useful textual label for that relationship instance. (This in addition to the relationship
        property URI and the object resource URI, which are also candidates for presentation to a user.) To this end,
        OSLC Servers MAY suppport a <code>dcterms:title</code> link property in RM resource representations where a
        relationship property is permitted, using the anchor approach outlined in the OSLC Core Links Guidance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Servers and Clients should be aware that the <code>dcterms:title</code> of a link is unrelated to the
        dcterms:title of the object resource. Indeed, links may carry other properties with names in common to the
        object of the link, but there is no specified relationship between these property values.

      <p>
        Architecture Management servers MUST use the vocabulary terms defined here where required, and with the meanings
        defined here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Architecture Management servers MAY augment this vocabulary with additional classes, properties, and
        individuals.
