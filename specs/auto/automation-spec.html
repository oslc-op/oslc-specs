  <section id='abstract'>
    <p>This specification defines the OSLC Automation domain, a RESTful web services interface for the management of domain
      specifica and supporting resources defined in the OSLC Core specification. To support these scenarios, this specification
      defines a set of HTTP-based RESTful interfaces in terms of HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT and DELETE, HTTP response codes,
      content type handling and resource formats.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This section is non-normative, i.e. it does not affect compliance. This specification builds on the [[!OSLCCore2]] to
      define the resources and operations supported by an Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC) Automation provider.
      Automation resources define automation plans, automation requests and automation results of the software development,
      test, deployment, and operations lifecycle. They represent individual resources as well as their relationships to other
      automation resources and to other linked resources outside of the automation domain. The intent of this specification
      is to define the set of HTTP-based RESTful interfaces in terms of HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT and DELETE, HTTP response
      codes, MIME type handling and resource formats. The capabilities of the interface definitions are driven by key integration
      scenarios and therefore don’t represent a complete setup of operations on resources or resource types. The resource
      formats and operations may not match exactly the native models supported by automation service providers but are intended
      to be compatible with them. Automation, as referenced in this specification, refers to the use of IT systems such as
      servers, workstations and smart hand-held devices to improve efficiency and reduce the need for manual human interactions
      in the software development, test, deployment, and operations lifecycle. See the
      <a href="http://open-services.net/wiki/automation/Automation-Scenarios">Automation Scenarios</a> page for examples from the build, test, deployment, and operations disciplines.

    <section id="formats">
      <h3>Resource Formats</h3>

      <p>In addition to the requirements for
        [[!OSLCCore2]] Defined Resource Representations, this section outlines further refinements and restrictions.</p>

      <p>See
        <a href="#Automation_Service_Provider_HTTP">HTTP Method support table</a> for further clarification on support for HTTP methods and media types for each OSLC
        Automation resource.</p>

      <p>For HTTP GET requests on all OSLC Automation and OSLC Core defined resource types,</p>

      <ul>
        <li> Automation Providers MUST provide RDF/XML representations. The RDF/XML representation SHOULD follow the guidelines
          outlined in the
          [[!OSLCCore2RepresentationGuidance]] for RDF/XML.
        </li>
        <li> Automation Providers MAY provide XML and JSON representations. If provided, the XML and JSON representations SHOULD
          follow the guidelines outlined in the
          [[!OSLCCore2RepresentationGuidance]].
        </li>
        <li> Automation Consumers requesting RDF/XML SHOULD be prepared for any valid RDF/XML document. Automation Consumers requesting
          XML SHOULD be prepared for representations that follow the guidelines outlined in the
          [[!OSLCCore2RepresentationGuidance]].
        </li>
        <li>
          Automation Providers SHOULD support an [X]HTML representation and a user interface (UI) preview as defined by
          [[!OSLCCore2RepresentationGuidance]].
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>For HTTP PUT/POST request formats for Automation resources,</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Automation Providers MUST accept RDF/XML representations and MAY accept XML representations. Automation Providers
          accepting RDF/XML SHOULD be prepared for any valid RDF/XML document. If XML is accepted, Automation Providers SHOULD
          be prepared for representations that follow the guidelines outlined in the
          [[!OSLCCore2RepresentationGuidance]].
        </li>
        <li>
          Automation Providers MAY accept XML and JSON representations. Automation Providers accepting XML or JSON SHOULD be prepared
          for representations that follow the guidelines outlined in the
          [[!OSLCCore2RepresentationGuidance]].
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>For HTTP GET response formats for Query requests,</p>

      <p>Automation Providers MUST provide RDF/XML and MAY provide JSON, XML, and Atom Syndication Format XML.</p>

      <p>When Automation Consumers request:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>application/rdf+xml</code> Automation Providers MUST respond with RDF/XML representation without restrictions.</li>
        <li><code>application/xml</code> Automation Providers SHOULD respond with OSLC-defined abbreviated XML representation as defined in the
        [[!OSLCCore2RepresentationGuidance]].</li>
        <li>
          <code>application/atom+xml</code> Automation Providers SHOULD respond with Atom Syndication Format XML representation as defined in the
          [[!OSLCCore2RepresentationGuidance]].
        </li>
        <li>
          If supported, the Atom Syndication Format XML representation SHOULD use RDF/XML representation without restrictions for the
          atom:content entries representing the resource representations.
        </li>
      </ul>

        Automation relationships to other resources are represented as properties whose values are the URI of the object or target
        resource. When an Automation relationship property is to be presented in a user interface, it may be helpful to provide
        an informative and useful textual label for that relationship instance. (This in addition to the relationship property
        URI and the object resource URI, which are also candidates for presentation to a user.) To this end, OSLC providers
        MAY support a
        <code>dcterms:title</code> link property in Automation resource representations, using the anchor approach outlined in the
        [[!OSLCCore2LinksGuidance]].

      <h3>Asynchronous and Synchronous Automation Execution</h3>

      <p>An OSLC Automation service provider is generally assumed to implement automation requests asynchronously. In this model,
        a client creates an automation request and then later queries a collection of automation results for the particular
        result(s) related to its request. For generality, it is also assumed that results may be contributed asynchronously
        by a set of distributed processes, where each contributor adds its contribution(s) to the result via HTTP PUT. When
        a provider creates an automation request, it can also include an automation result, which might or might not yet
        be finished at the point in time when the provider responds to the create request. Providers can persist automation
        results for as long as they deem reasonable. Consumers are assumed to poll for updates to automation results until
        they have finished. Once a request has finished, the provider may remove it at any time. An automation result is
        &#8220;finished&#8221; when it has an
        <code>oslc_auto:state</code> predicate with an object of
        <code>oslc_auto:complete</code> or
        <code>oslc_auto:canceled</code> or an
        <code>oslc_auto:verdict</code> property with a value other than
        <code>oslc_auto:unavailable</code>.</p>

    <section id='Automation-Provider-Sub-Domains'>
      <h3>Automation Provider Sub-Domains</h3>

      <p>An instance of an OSLC Automation service provider might provide services for one or more particular automation sub-domains
        (e.g. test or build automation). Automation service providers MAY declare sub-domain information in the Service Provider
        document by specifying a sub-domain value in the
        <code>oslc:usage</code> attribute on the
        <code>oslc:Service</code> resource in the Service Provider document. Valid sub-domain values are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>http://open-services.net/ns/auto#Build</strong>: Indicates that the related service provider or services provide
          build automation capabilities - the process of converting source code artifacts into software artifacts such as
          executables, libraries and documentation.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>http://open-services.net/ns/auto#Test</strong>: Indicates that the related service provider or services provide
          test automation capabilities - the process of executing tests on a system under test and comparing the results
          of the tests to pass/fail conditions.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>http://open-services.net/ns/auto#Deploy</strong>: Indicates that the related service provider or services provide
          deployment capabilities - the process of executing processes and procedures to ready systems and software for use.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>An automation service provider which is a general-purpose automation provider, or a provider not wanting to provide
        a sub-domain should provide an
        <code>oslc:usage</code> value of
        <strong>http://open-services.net/ns/auto</strong>. If no
        <code>oslc:usage</code> attribute indicating a sub-domain is present, the default is assumed to be
        <strong>http://open-services.net/ns/auto</strong>.</p>

      <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> OSLC Automation does not require providers to keep resources accessible forever. Clients should not
        expect automation results to be available for any particular length of time once the request has
        <a href="#Asynchronous-and-Synchronous-Automation-Execution">finished</a>. Some providers might respond to an AutomationRequest creation request with an AutomationRequest that
        is also an AutomationResult, and might make the result inaccessible immediately thereafter.</p>

      <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> If an OSLC Automation provider does expose a Query Capability that applies to AutomationResults, and
        if its AutomationRequest creation responses are not also AutomationResults, then its Query Capability is the only
        Automation-defined way for clients to find the corresponding AutomationResults.</p>

      <section id='Immediate-Execution-Creation-Dialog'>
        <h4>Immediate-Execution Creation Dialog</h4>

        <p>An &#8220;immediate-execution&#8221; creation dialog is one that creates an Automation Request and makes it eligible
          for execution as soon as it is created. This is the only form of creation dialog that was defined in OSLC Automation
          2.0. OSLC Automation 2.1 defines the term &#8220;immediate-execution creation dialog&#8221; and the
          <code>oslc:usage</code> URI
          <code>http://open-services.net/ns/auto#ImmediateExecution</code> (
          <code>oslc_auto:ImmediateExecution</code>) to distinguish them from
          <a href="#Deferred-Execution-Creation-Dialog">deferred-execution creation dialogs</a>.</p>

        <p>OSLC Automation 2.1 consumers MUST interpret an
          <code>oslc_auto:AutomationRequest</code> creation dialog that has neither
          <code>oslc:usage oslc_auto:ImmediateExecution</code> set nor
          <code>oslc:usage oslc_auto:DeferredExecution</code> set as being an &#8220;immediate-execution creation dialog&#8221;. This is to maintain compatibility with OSLC
          Automation 2.0 providers.</p>

        <p>If an OSLC Automation provider offers both immediate-execution and deferred-execution creation dialogs, it MUST provide
          <code>oslc_auto:ImmediateExecution</code> or
          <code>oslc_auto:DeferredExecution</code> as a
          <code>oslc:usage</code> value (respectively) on the
          <code>oslc:Dialog</code> creation dialog resources. Such a provider
          <strong>SHOULD</strong> also set
          <code>oslc:default</code> as a
          <code>oslc:usage</code> value on the immediate-execution dialogs, to guide OSLC Automation 2.0 consumers to use those dialogs and not
          the deferred-execution ones.</p>

      </section>

      <section id='Deferred-Execution-Creation-Dialog'>
        <h4>Deferred-Execution Creation Dialog</h4>

        <p>A Deferred-Execution Creation Dialog is a
          [[!OSLCCore2]] resource creation delegated user interface dialog that creates an Automation Request but
          <strong>does not</strong> make it eligible for execution. A deferred-execution creation dialog MUST comply with all Core
          requirements on
          [[!OSLCCore2]] resource creation delegated user interface dialogs. One important consequence of this is that all facilities
          available on resource creation delegated user interface dialogs, for example
          [[!OSLCCore2]] pre-filling, apply equally to deferred-execution creation dialogs.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Non-normative note: The Automation 2.0 specification only provided a standard way to create Automation Requests
            that are eligible for execution once they are created; Automation 2.1 adds deferred-execution creation dialogs
            to allow creation without execution eligibility in a standard way. This meets
            [[!OSLCAutomationScenarios]] template scenarios, while retaining compatibility with Automation 2.0 clients by keeping
            the behavior of
            <code>oslc:creationDialog</code> resources unchanged from 2.0.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>This specification defines the
          <code>oslc:usage</code> URI
          <code>http://open-services.net/ns/auto#DeferredExecution</code> (
          <code>oslc_auto:DeferredExecution</code>) to allow clients to discover deferred-execution creation dialogs that an Automation provider supplies, amongst
          any other dialogs in their
          <code>oslc:Service</code> resources, as shown in
          [[!OSLCAutomationSamples]] immediate and deferred dialog provider. The corresponding resource shape is shown
          <a href="#Resource.3A-Dialog">in an earlier section</a>.</p>

        <p>One anticipated usage of deferred execution dialogs is to create
          <code>AutomationRequest</code>s for later scheduling: a template
          <code>AutomationRequest</code> is created (but never actually executed) during a configuration phase, a copy is saved by the client, and then
          the copy is used at future point(s) in time as pre-fill input to a standard 2.0 Automation Request creation factory
          or dialog. &#8220;Template&#8221; in this context refers to the client&#8217;s usage of the
          <code>AutomationRequest</code> resource, rather than implying anything about its content (see also the section in
          [[!OSLCCore2Actions]]). Clients typically store templates as opaque representations; this specification does nothing
          to force or discourage any particular behavior.</p>

        <p>Any
          <code>AutomationRequest</code> created by a deferred-execution creation dialog is
          <strong>especially likely</strong> to be short-lived (cleaned up by the server shortly after creation); while this can
          be true of resources in general, for historical reasons (the 2.0 creation factory behavior described above) it
          is particularly important in this case as a common usage pattern. As a consequence, the consumer SHOULD get its
          representation immediately after creating it.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Non-normative note: we suggest that providers allow these resources to exist for at least 15 minutes, but the actual
            value used is implementation-dependent.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <section id='Deferred-Execution-Creation-Dialog-Action-Binding'>
          <h5>Executing a previously constructed Automation Request</h5>

          <p>When a deferred-execution creation dialog creates an Automation Request, it is not queued for execution unless
            the client takes some explicit further action; it is the responsibility of the consumer to decide when (if ever)
            it is ready to be executed. OSLC defines options to initiate execution that include the following:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Provide it as input to a standard (immediately execution-eligible) Automation
                [[!OSLCCore2]] creation factory.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Provide it as input to a standard (immediately execution-eligible) Automation creation dialog that supports
                pre-fill.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <blockquote>
            <p>Note: assuming that the request is successful, it is important to recognize that the cases above all result in
              the creation of a
              <strong>new</strong> Automation Request, with a
              <strong>different URI</strong> than anything provided as an input. The provider may provide other ways, in addition
              to or in place of these, for the consumer to use when it is ready to have the Automation Request executed.
              OSLC currently has no scenarios requiring the definition of a way to change the state to make
              <strong>the same (input)</strong> request eligible for execution.</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>OSLC defines options for locating those immediate-execution resources, for example creation factories and delegated
            creation dialogs, that include the following:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Consumers can examine an OSLC Service Provider document&#8217;s
                <code>oslc:Service</code> resources. In many scenarios, Automation clients will only need to implement the
                <a href="#pattern-autoreq-creation-factory">Creation Factory interaction pattern</a> to initiate execution, although other possibilities exist.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Consumers can use
                <code>oslc:binding</code> properties on the
                <code>oslc_auto:DeferredExecution</code> dialog resource to simplify the process of locating appropriate immediate-execution resources. Those consumers
                choose at least one Actions specification profile, and implement the interaction patterns described in that
                profile. They are only able to consume deferred-execution dialogs whose bindings use an interaction pattern
                that the consumer implements.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>The Automation provider MUST describe how to immediately execute an Automation Request created by a deferred-execution
            dialog using one or more
            <code>oslc:binding</code> properties on the
            <code>oslc_auto:DeferredExecution</code> dialog resource. If the deferred-execution dialog is discoverable from a Service in a
            [[!OSLCCore2]] Service Provider, then the provider MUST supply at least one immediate-execution binding whose target uses
            the
            <a href="#pattern-autoreq-creation-factory">Automation creation factory interaction pattern</a>. If multiple
            <code>oslc:binding</code> properties are present, they MUST be equivalent alternatives to each other, as defined by Core Actions.</p>

          <p>When the second class of consumer from the list above is ready to execute an Automation Request acting as a template,
            it uses one of the
            <code>oslc:binding</code> properties on the deferred-execution dialog to immediately execute the action (often, by creating a new Automation
            Request with a different URI). The consumer does this by following the selected
            [[!OSLCCore2Actions]] binding&#8217;s instructions</a>; its interaction pattern might be
            <a href="#OSLC-Automation-Actions-interaction-patterns">defined by this specification</a>, or might be defined by another specification. A consumer chooses which
            <code>oslc:binding</code> value to use based on which interaction patterns it understands. If there are no
            <code>oslc:binding</code> values whose interaction patterns are understood by the consumer then the Automation Request acting as a template
            cannot be used by this consumer and the consumer SHOULD indicate this to the user instead of allowing them to
            use the deferred-execution dialog. A
            [[!OSLCAutomationSamples]] deferred execution binding1 full example is available in the
            <a href="#Appendix-A.3A-Samples">companion Samples document</a>.</p>

      <h3>State and Verdict properties</h3>

        own vocabulary). It is expected that the state and verdict values will be URI references to property values, but
        inline resources defining the state and verdict property values are also valid. Automation service providers MUST
        use at least one verdict (Automation Results) and state (Automation Requests and Results) defined in the OSLC automation
        vocabulary in addition to any states or verdicts not in the Automation vocabulary.</p>

    <h2>OSLC Actions and Automation</h2>

    <p>This specification defines extensions to the
      <a href="/wiki/core/Actions-2.0/">OSLC Actions 2.0 specification</a>. Actions provide &#8220;a means of advertising actions (or operations) that can
      be performed on (or in the context of) a specific resource&#8221;. This relates to Automation in two ways: firstly,
      Automation Requests can be used as an
      <em>interaction pattern</em> by which actions can be executed, and secondly, Actions can provide a way to aid management
      and the lifecycle of automation resources.</p>

    <p>The Actions specification reuses Automation resources to define an Automation Request interaction pattern, which can
      be used to execute actions. Actions also defines a
      <em>specification profile</em> that implementations can use, which provides interoperability based on providers and consumers
      both using a common interaction pattern. This specification extends the Actions specification by
      <a href="#OSLC-Automation-Actions-interaction-patterns">defining interaction patterns</a> which are useful in the management of automation resources.</p>

        <p>For information on how to discover currently-available actions on resources and how to choose which binding to use
          for execution, see the

        <h4>Discovering actions that will be executable after an Automation Request completes</h4>

        <p>One Automation use of Core&#8217;s actions is to advertise actions that become available after an Automation Request
          completes: for example, tearing down a deployed system, promoting or deleting a build. If the execution of the
          Automation Request resulted in a new resource being created (e.g. a resource representing the deployed system,
          or a resource representing the build) then it is expected that newly created resource would be linked to as an
          <code>oslc_auto:contribution</code> on the Automation Result, and any action in the context of that new resource would be linked to as an
          <code>oslc:action</code> on that resource. However, consumers may not know which contributions to check for action, so any actions that
          would make sense to follow up the execution of an Automation Request - whether immediately or at a later time -
          SHOULD be advertised on the Automation Result in addition to (or instead of) on a contribution.</p>

        <section id='Future-actions'>
          <h5>Future actions</h5>

          <p>It is sometimes useful to know what actions will be available before an Automation Request is created (for example,
            for scheduling automated processes that will execute in their entirety without user intervention). Users might
            prefer such Automation Plans over otherwise equivalent ones that lack the ability to automate cleanup after themselves,
            so in fact it can be useful to know about future actions when selecting a Plan, before any Automation Request
            has even been created. Note:
            [[!OSLCCore2FutureActions]] mentions other uses of future actions.</p>

          <p>To enable cases like these, providers MAY link to
            <em>future actions</em> using the
            <code>oslc:futureAction</code> predicate. When an Automation provider provides future action link(s) on an Automation Plan, they SHOULD link
            to resources of type
            <code>oslc:Action</code> which describe an action that may be executed after an execution of the Automation Plan has completed. As such,
            these
            <code>oslc:Action</code> resources SHOULD NOT contain any bindings that can be executed immediately.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>Non-normative note: Bindings using the &#8220;deferred execution dialog interaction pattern&#8221; may be present,
              but this specification does not define how to use them for future actions. It would not make sense to specify
              a deferred execution dialog execution binding for a future action, because its mandatory immediate-execution
              binding cannot become available until after an Automation Request has been created.</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>These future action resources describe what kind of actions are available on the Automation Result, so consumers
            can present these to users in preparation for when the execution has completed, and so the
            <code>oslc:Action</code> resources SHOULD include all the properties needed to render a display of the action. These
            <code>oslc:Action</code> resources SHOULD NOT be anonymous (RDF blank) nodes, so they can be linked to by the executable actions on the
            results using the predicate below.</p>

          <p>The execution of these future actions requires an immediately executable action on an Automation Result. When an
            Automation Plan containing future actions is executed, each action applicable to the generated result SHOULD
            have an equivalent immediately executable action, linked to using the
            <code>oslc:action</code> predicate, from the Automation Result. Each of these actions SHOULD use the
            <code>oslc:executes</code> predicate to link to the future action on the Plan that it relates to. This allows consumers to map a user selection
            of a future action on the plan to an executable action on the result. Each future action SHOULD have
            <em>at most one</em> executable action linking to it from each Result. (Note: If a Plan&#8217;s future action
            <code>PFA</code> specifies a binding using the deferred execution dialog interaction pattern, then the corresponding Result&#8217;s
            action bindings linking back to
            <code>PFA</code> might be intended as immediate-execution bindings for the deferred execution dialog (see below), but this specification
            does not require that usage).</p>

      <h3>Deciding how to use Actions and Automation together</h3>

      <p>This section is non-normative.</p>

      <p>When implementing a provider of Automation Plans, you can decide whether to expose those plans through Actions or not.
        This section addresses that decision.</p>

      <p>There are two main issues that come into play: discovery and execution. In the Automation 2.0 specification, which
        predated the OSLC Actions specification, Automation Plans were discovered through query capabilities or selection
        dialogs on a service provider. This was the only way to discover them. Actions provide an additional option for discovery,
        in the context of any given resource. That is, if a given Automation Plan &#8220;acts on&#8221; another resource,
        it makes sense for that resource to point to that Automation Plan, including information on what executing that plan
        will achieve. (Plans discovered via Actions can still be made discoverable through the normal means as well, for
        consumers who don&#8217;t want to browse other resources, but instead just want to directly list or select an Automation
        Plan).
      </p>

      <p>Automation Plans have a well-defined means of requesting execution. Automation Plans are one option for how providers
        can allow their actions to be executed. However, unlike plain Automation Plans discovered from a query capability
        or selection dialog, actions allow providers to specify other means of execution in addition to or instead of Automation
        Plans (while still supporting predictable iteroperability through being implemented against &#8220;specification
        profiles&#8221;). See the information on &#8220;interaction patterns&#8221; and &#8220;specification profiles&#8221;
        in the OSLC Actions 2.0 specification for more information.</p>

        the case. That is, a tear-down action typically has the opposite semantics from a

        <a href="#Deferred-Execution-Creation-Dialog">Deferred-Execution Creation Dialog</a> interaction pattern as an

        the following stages:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Configuration</strong>: The consumer displays a deferred-execution creation dialog to a user for them to configure
          an action. An arbitrary time delay occurs. This accommodates use cases like calendar-schedule execution and manual
          approval cycles.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Execution</strong>: One or more executions of the configured action. Each execution uses a new resource with a
          separate lifecycle from the previously configured action, and might either require a user (to supply final configuration
          values) or might be fully automated.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>In this interaction pattern, the consumer is in charge of when the action is executed. (If the provider needs to be
        in charge of when the action becomes executable, the standard &#8220;delegated UI dialog for immediate execution&#8221;
        interaction pattern can be used, with provider exercising whatever degree of control it needs to; for example, creating

              <li>If and when the consumer comes to execute the action at a later time, then the consumer selects an interaction
                pattern and follows its instructions, but with the changes described under
                <a href="#Template-dialog-pattern-execution-bindings">immediate-execution bindings</a> below. The client determines the status of this phase of its goal using
                the selected interaction pattern.

                <ol>
                  <li>The consumer considers for selection interaction patterns it supports amongst the immediate-execution bindings
                    for the deferred-execution creation dialog (see
                    <a href="#Template-dialog-pattern-provider-constraints">Additional provider constraints</a> above). </li>
                  <li>The consumer ignores any interaction pattern prohibited by its defining document from use as immediate-execution
                    bindings for deferred execution dialogs,
                    <a href="#prohibited-immediate-execution-bindings">like those prohibited here</a>.</li>
                  <li>A single immediate-execution binding might match the recognition rule for multiple interaction patterns;
                    only explicitly prohibited interaction patterns are disqualified from consideration via the preceding
                    step. For example, if three patterns are considered and one is prohibited, the consumer is still free
                    to select either of the remaining two, even if all three exist on a single binding.</li>
                  <li>The consumer is free to either ignore or retain for consideration interaction patterns whose defining document
                    is silent on their use in this context. This is likely a decision made when the consumer code is written,
                    although it can be made at run time as well.</li>
                  <li>Interaction patterns defined elsewhere will help consumers by explicitly stating as part of their definition
                    if and how they can be used as immediate-execution bindings for deferred execution dialogs. Consumers
                    might avoid using interaction patterns that fail to do so, because of a reduced likelihood for interoperability.</li>

        <h4>Immediate-execution bindings</h4>

        <p>The delegated UI dialog for later execution interaction pattern involves two bindings: one at configuration time
          that creates the configuration for use at the later time, and a second binding that once executed (with the configuration
          returned from the first binding) triggers the action immediately. Hence, these second bindings are called &#8220;immediate-execution
          bindings&#8221;.
        </p>

        <p>Immediate-execution bindings MAY use any of the following interaction patterns for the execution of this interaction
          pattern. In each case, the input representation MUST be replaced by the representation saved during the configuration
          stage, regardless of whether it is used as a request body, dialog pre-fill, or other purpose by the patterns listed
          below.

          Consumers MUST NOT use these interaction patterns on immediate-execution bindings, even if the binding meets the pattern&#8217;s

      <h3>Parameters Added During Execution</h3>

      <p>When Automation Requests are created for an Automation Plan, the creator of the request supplies
        <code>oslc_auto:inputParameter</code> attributes based on the
        <code>oslc_auto:parameterDefinition</code> attributes found in the Automation Plan instance. There are scenarios where a provider may add additional parameters
        during the course of execution and a consumer of Automation Results might wish to discover what these added parameters
        will be. One method of discovery is for the consumer to simply examine the
        <code>oslc_auto:outputParameter</code> attributes of the Automation Result. This may not be sufficient for consumers who have a need to know the added
        parameters prior to executing the Automation Plan.</p>

      <p>Service providers can advertise which parameters will be added during the course of execution using the
        <code>oslc:readOnly</code> attribute of the
        <code>oslc:Property</code> resource which is the basis for the
        <code>oslc_auto:parameterDefinition</code> in the Automation Plan. By setting
        <code>oslc:readOnly</code> to
        <strong>true</strong>, the provider indicates that this parameter is not available for the consumer to set, but will or may
        be added to the Automation Result&#8217;s
        <code>oslc_auto:outputParameters</code>. Whether it is guaranteed to be added to the Result is based on the value of
        <code>oslc:occurs</code> for the specific parameterDefinition.</p>

      <p>Example 1: An Automation Plan parameterDefinition fragment showing a parameter guaranteed to be added during execution</p>

      <pre><code>&lt;oslc_auto:parameterDefinition&gt;
    &lt;oslc:name&gt;DeployedIPAddress&lt;/oslc:name&gt;
    &lt;oslc:readOnly&gt;true&lt;/oslc:readOnly&gt;

    &lt;oslc:valueType rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"/&gt;
&lt;/oslc_auto:parameterDefinition&gt;
</code></pre>

      <p>Example 2: An Automation Plan parameterDefinition fragment showing a parameter which may be added during execution</p>

      <pre><code>&lt;oslc_auto:parameterDefinition&gt;
    &lt;oslc:name&gt;FailedTestName&lt;/oslc:name&gt;
    &lt;oslc:readOnly&gt;true&lt;/oslc:readOnly&gt;

  <section id="conformance">
    <h2>Conformance</h2>
    <p>This specification is based on OSLC Core Specification. OSLC Automation consumers and service providers MUST be compliant
      with both the core specification and this Automation specification, and SHOULD follow all the guidelines and recommendations
      in both these specifications.</p>

    <p>The following table summarizes the requirements from OSLC Core Specification as well as some (but not all) additional
      requirements specific to Automation. See the full content of the Automation specification for all requirements. Note
      that this specification further restricts some of the requirements for OSLC Core Specification as noted in the Origin
      column of the compliance table. See further sections in this specification or the OSLC Core Specification to get further
      details on each of these requirements.
    </p>

    <P>Any consumer or service provider behaviors are allowed unless explicitly prohibited by this or dependent specifications;
      conditional permissive requirements, especially those qualified with “MAY”, are implicitly covered by the preceding
      clause. While technically redundant in light of that broad permission, OSLC specifications do still make explicit MAY-qualified
      statements in cases where the editors believe doing so is likely to add clarity.</P>
