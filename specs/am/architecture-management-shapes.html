        OSLC Architecture Management Version 3.0. Part 2: Vocabulary defines the OSLC Architecture Management RDF

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        RDF vocabularies define the terms and resources for a domain of interest, life-cycle management in the case of
        OSLC Architecture Management. These vocabularies are often specified in an open manner, without providing
        information such as property domain and range assertions, cardinalities, etc. This helps keep the vocabulary
        applicable for a wide range of uses and furthering integration with other vocabularies.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, it is often desirable to closed down a vocabulary with specific constraints to facilitate using the
        vocabulary for a specific purpose. This document specifies the constraints for using the OSLC Architecture
        Management vocabulary in OSLC. Different sets of constraints may be applied to a vocabulary in order to tailor
        its use, without overly constraining the vocabulary for other usages.
      </p>

      <p>
        These constraints apply to the core vocabulary defined in
        <a href="architecture-management-vocab.html">OSLC Architecture Management Version 3.0. Part 2: Vocabulary</a>.
      </p>
      <section id="terminology" class="informative">
        <h1>Terminology</h1>
        <p>
          Terminology is based on OSLC Core Overview [[!OSLCCore3]], W3C Linked Data Platform [[!LDP]], W3C's
          Architecture of the World Wide Web [[WEBARCH]], Hyper-text Transfer Protocol [[!HTTP11]]. Terminology for this
          specification is defined in part 1 of the multi-part specification.

    <section id="resourceConstraints">
      <h2>Resource Constraints</h2>
      <p>
        This section specifies the constraints for the Architecture Management resources. The resource properties are
        not limited to the ones defined in this specification, AM Servers may provide additional properties. It is
        recommended that any additional properties exist in their own unique namespace and not use the namespaces
        defined in these specifications.
      </p>

      <section id="resource">
        <h3>Resource: Resource</h3>
        <p>
          An Architecture Management Resource (AMR) is a generic resource format that can be used to represent any type
          of specific architecture resource such as a UML Class, Use Case, or Business Process Diagram.
        </p>

        <div
          title="Shapes for Architecture Management"
          data-include="./architecture-management-shapes.ttl#ResourceShape"

          data-include-replace="true"

        ></div>
      </section>

      <section id="linkType">
        <h3>Resource: LinkType</h3>
        <p>
          A Link Type Resource (LTR) represents type of link that is or can be used when defining links from AM
          resources. The type has an ID (expressed as a string), whose universally accepted semantics may be defined
          elsewhere. This resource represents the definition as it is used by this service provider. This resource is
          meant as a convenience for clients to get a list of known/registered link types with human readable labels and
          definitions that can be used in client user interfaces when links are being created.
        </p>

        <p>
          The resource defines the properties rdfs:label and rdfs:comments for the link type URI. The link type URI is
          made type: <code>http://open-services.net/ns/am#LinkType</code> via an <code>rdf:type</code> property. The
          remaining properties may be properties of the link type URI, or on a separate resource managed by the service
          provider. In the case where the service provider owns the domain of the link type URI these can be the same,
          and all properties can be on the same link type URI.
        </p>

        <p>
          Links from AMR resources are managed in accordance with the
          <a href="https://tools.oasis-open.org/version-control/svn/oslc-core/trunk/supporting-docs/link-guidance.html"
            >OSLC Core Guidance on Links and Relationships</a
          >. They appear as simple properties in the resource. Links MAY include inlined values for the target and MAY
          include anchor properties on the link itself. AM Servers SHOULD support LinkType Resources for clients to get
          a list of known and acceptable link properties.
