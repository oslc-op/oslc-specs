<section id='abstract'>
  <p>This specification defines the OSLC Architecture Management domain, a RESTful web services interface for the management of architectural resources and relationships between those and related resources such as product change requests, activities, tasks, requirements or test cases. To support these scenarios, this specification defines a set of HTTP-based RESTful interfaces in terms of HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT and DELETE, as well as HTTP response codes, content type handling and resource formats.</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>This specification defines a RESTful web services interface for the Architecture Management (AM) domain. This domain addresses the management of product design artifacts including models, and relationships with other resources such as requirements, testing resources and change requests. To support these scenarios, this specification defines a set of HTTP-based RESTful interfaces in terms of HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT and DELETE, HTTP response codes, content type handling and resource formats..</p>

  <p>The intent of this specification is to define the capabilities needed to support integration scenarios defined by the Architecture Management working group and not to provide a comprehensive interface to Architecture Management. The resource formats and operations may not match exactly the native artifacts supported by architecture management AM Servers but are intended to be compatible with them. The approach to supporting these scenarios is to delegate operations, as driven by service provider contributed user interfaces, as much as possible and not require a service provider to expose its complete data model and application logic.</p>

  <p>This specification is a [[!OSLCCore3]] compliant specification, and as such most of its content are references to [[!OSLCCore3]].</p>

  <section id='terminology'>
    <h3>Terminology</h3>
      <dl class="spaced">
      <dt><dfn>Resource</dfn></dt>
      <dd>An artifact used in the Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) space. A resource is directly addressable with an absolute URL.</dd>

      <dt><dfn>Architecture Management Resource (AMR)</dfn></dt>
      <dd>Directly addressable resources of some domain/notation (i.e. UML,
        BMPN, ER) that represent an abstraction of some behavior or construct of
        a system under development. An AMR maintains its identity after
        refactoring. In the semantic web, an AMR might correspond to a graph
        that is an instance of some vocabulary or micro-theory.</dd>

        <dt><dfn>Link</dfn></dt>
      <dd>A logical relationship from one resource to another resource. An OSLC AM Link is uni-directional.
        The subject (source) of a link represents the resource that "knows
        about" and is referencing another resource (target). The type of
        relationship is given by a predicate URI (link type). In semantic web
        terminology, a link would correspond to an RDF statement with a subject
        (source), a predicate (type) and object (target). The predicate could be
        defined by property in an RDF schema.</dd>


         <dt><dfn>Link type (LT)</dfn></dt>
      <dd>A URI that represents the type of a link. In semantic web terminology it is the predicate of an
        RDF triple. It clarifies the type of relationship between two resources.
        Link Type URIs may be defined locally, within the OSLC, or externally
        (i.e. Dublin Core terms). Link types could be defined in RDF
        Schemas.</dd>


         <dt><dfn>Link type Resource (LTR)</dfn></dt>
      <dd>A resource that contains human consumable information about a Link Type, like its human readable
        name and description. The resource is managed by the AM provider. The
        information may be about a Link Type in a different domain (i.e. Dublin
        Core Terms or OWL). The main use of an LTR is for clients who want to
        build a UI for users that clearly labels potential link types.</dd>


    <dt>AM Client</dt>
    <dd>An implementation of the OSLC Architecture Management specifications as a client. OSLC AM Clients consume services provided by AM servers.</dd>

    <dt>AM Server</dt>
    <dd>A server implementing the OSLC Architecture Management domain specifications. OSLC AM clients consume services provided by AM Servers. The use of the terms Client and Server are intended to distinguish typical consumers and providers of OSLC resources in a distributed environment based on REST. A particular application component could be a client for some OSLC domain services and a server for the same or another domain.</dd>

<section id="baseRequirements">
<h2>Base Requirements</h2>

<p>The following sub-sections define the mandatory and optional requirements for an OSLC Architecture Management (OSLC AM) server.</p>

<section id="baseCompliance">
<h2>Base Compliance</h2>
<p class='conformance'>This specification is based on [[!OSLCCore3]]. OSLC AM servers
MUST be compliant with both the core specification,  MUST follow all the mandatory requirements in the normative sections of this specification, and SHOULD follow all the guidelines and recommendations in both
these specifications.</p>

<p class='conformance'>An OSLC AM server MUST implement the domain vocabulary defined in <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/oslc-domains/am/v2.1/am-v2.1-part2-architecture-management-vocab.html">OSLC Architecture Management Version 2.1. Part 2: Vocabulary</a>

<p>The following table summarizes the requirements from OSLC Core Specification
as well as some additional requirements specific to the AM domain. Note that
this specification further restricts some of the requirements from the OSLC Core
Specification. See the previous sections in this specification or the
OSLC Core Specification to get further details on each of these
requirements.</p>

<section id="versioning">
<h2 id="specificationversioningspec_versioning">Specification Versioning</h2>

<p>This specification follows the specification version guidelines given in [[!OSLCCore3]].</p>
</section>

<section id="namespaces">
<h2>Namespaces</h2>

<p> In addition to the namespace URIs and namespace prefixes <code>oslc</code>, <code>rdf</code>, <code>dcterms</code> and <code>foaf</code> defined in the [[!OSLCCore3]], OSLC AM defines the namespace URI of <code>http://open-services.net/ns/am#</code> with a preferred namespace prefix of <code>oslc_am</code>.</p>

</section>
<section id="formats">
<h2>Resource Formats</h2>

<p>In addition to the requirements for resource representations in [[!OSLCCore3]], this section outlines further refinements and restrictions.</p>

<p>For HTTP GET/PUT/POST requests on all OSLC AM and OSLC Core defined resource types,
</p>

<ul>
  <li class='conformance'>AM Servers MUST support RDF/XML representations with media-type <code>application/rdf+xml</code>. AM Clients should be prepared to deal with any valid RDF/XML document.
  </li>
  <li class='conformance'>AM Servers MUST support XML representations with media-type <code>application/xml</code>. The XML representations MUST follow the guidelines outlined in the <a href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OSLCCoreSpecAppendixRepresentations">OSLC Core Representations Guidance</a> to maintain compatibility with [[!OSLCCore2]].
  </li>
  <li class='conformance'>AM Servers MAY support JSON representations with media-type <code>application/json</code>. The JSON representations MUST follow the guidelines outlined in the <a href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OSLCCoreSpecAppendixRepresentations">OSLC Core Representations Guidance</a> to maintain compatibility with [[!OSLCCore2]].
  </li>
</ul>
</section>

  <section id="resourceOps">
<h2>Resource Operations</h2>

<p class='conformance'>For compatibility with OSLC 2.0, OSLC AM Servers MAY accept the OSLC Core Version header (OSLC-Core-Version: 2.0) in any HTTP request as specified in [[!OSLCCore3]], and return an OSLC AM 2.0 representation (including the OSLC-Core-Version: 2.0 header). If the OSLC Core Version header is absent on a request, or has some undefined value, the OSLC AM Server MUST return an AM 3.0 representation.</p>

<p>Since OSLC 3.0 is a compatible superset of OSLC 2.0, an AM 3.0 representation may also be an AM 2.0 representation, even if the OSLC Core Version header is absent.</p>

<p class='conformance'>OSLC AM Servers MUST support HTTP GET requests on Architecture Management Resources (AMR), with an Accept header of <code>application/rdf+xml</code>, and return the RDF/XML representation of the resource.</p>

<p class='conformance'>OSLC AM Servers SHOULD support HTTP GET requests on Architecture Management Resources (AMR), with an Accept header of an HTML type ( <code>application/html</code>, <code>application/xhtml</code>), and return either an HTML/XHTML representation of the resource or redirect the client to another URL that can (i.e. 302 Redirect).</p>

<p class='conformance'>OSLC AM Servers SHOULD support HTTP GET requests for user interface (UI) preview of Architecture Management Resources (AMR) as defined by [[!OSLCPreview]].</p>

<p class='conformance'>OSLC AM Servers SHOULD support resource modifications on Architecture Management Resources (AMR) with standard HTTP PUT and DELETE methods. AM Servers MAY limit modifications in any way they want. For example a service provider may limit updates to resources to simple link properties of link types already defined in the provider. Modification methods MUST use the If-Match header for concurrency management. Providers MAY discard such properties and continue a PUT operation without warning to the client.</p>

<p class='conformance'>OSLC AM Servers SHOULD support resource modifications on LinkType Resources (LTR) with standard HTTP PUT and DELETE methods. AM Servers MAY limit modifications in any way they want. For example a service provider may not support additional properties. Modification methods SHOULD use the If-Match header for concurrency management.</p>

<section id="requestProps">
<h3>Requesting and Updating Properties</h3>

<section id="requestSubset">
<h4>Requesting a Subset of Properties</h4>

<p class='conformance'>An OSLC AM server MAY support the <code>oslc.properties</code> URL query parameter on an HTTP
  GET request on individual resource request or a collection of resources by
  query. If the <code>oslc.properties</code> query parameter is omitted on the request, then all
  resource properties MUST be provided in the response.</p>
</section>

<section id="updateSubset">
<h4>Updating a Subset of Properties</h4>

<p class='conformance'>An OSLC AM client MAY request that a subset of a resource's properties be updated by
  identifying those properties to be modified using the <code>oslc.properties</code> URL
  parameter on a HTTP PUT request.</p>

</section>

<section id="updatingMultiValueProps">
<h4>Updating Multi-Valued Properties</h4>

<p class='conformance'>An OSLC AM Server MAY support updating a subset of a resource's properties by using the [[LDPPatch]] <code>PATCH</code> method.</p>

<p class='conformance'>For compatibility with [[!OSLCCore2]], an AM Server MAY also support partial update by identifying those properties to be modified using the <code>oslc.properties</code> URL parameter on a HTTP PUT request.</p>

<p class='conformance'>If the parameter <code>oslc.properties</code> contains a valid resource property on the request that is not provided in the content, the server MUST set the resource's property to a null or empty value. If the parameter <code>oslc.properties</code> contains an invalid resource property, then a <code>409 Conflict</code> MUST be returned.</p>

<h2>AM Server Capabilities</h2>

<section id="resourceShapes1">
<h3>Resource Shapes</h3>

  <p class='conformance'>OSLC AM servers SHOULD support Resource Shapes as defined in [[!OSLCShapes]].</p>

</section>

<section id="resources">
<h3>Service Provider Resources</h3>

  <p class='conformance'>OSLC AM Servers MUST provide a ServiceProvider Resource that can be retrieved at a implementation dependent URI.</p>

<p class='conformance'>OSLC AM Servers MUST provide a ServiceProviderCatalog Resource that can be retrieved at a implementation dependent URI.</p>

<p class='conformance'>OSLC AM Servers MUST provide an <code>oslc:serviceProvider</code> property for their defined resources that will be the URI to a ServiceProvider Resource. This does not prevent AM Servers from providing multiple servie provider properties with different values, if the service provider supports multiple OSLC domain specifications, and the resource is applicable to multiple domains.</p>

<p class='conformance'>OSLC AM Servers MUST supply a value of <code>http://open-services.net/ns/am#</code> for the property <code>oslc:domain</code> on either <code>oslc:ServiceProvider</code> or <code>oslc:ServiceProviderCatalog</code> resources.</p>

</section>


<section id="creationfactories">
<h3>Creation Factories</h3>

<p class='conformance'>OSLC AM Servers MAY support CreationFactories as defined by [[!OSLCCore3]].</p>

<p>OSLC AM Servers MAY discard properties it does not recognize and continue the POST operation without warning to the client. The returned resource will contain the accepted properties (and server generated properties like the dcterms:identifer) so clients will be able to confirm if required what was accepted.</p>

<p class='conformance'>If OSLC AM Servers support the creation of resources from the OSLC defined <code>oslc_am:Resource</code> format, there MUST be at least one Creation Factory entry in the Services definition, and its <code>oslc:usage</code> property MUST be set to <code>http://open-services/ns/core#default</code>. The <code>oslc:resourceType</code> MUST be set to <code>http://open-services.net/ns/am#Resource</code>.</p>

<p class='conformance'>If OSLC AM Servers support the creation of resources from a resource other than <code>oslc_am:Resource</code>, there MUST be a separate creation services definition whose <code>oslc:usage</code> property MUST NOT be set to <code>http://open-services/ns/core#default</code>.</p>

</section>

<section id="querycapabilities">
<h3>Query Capabilities</h3>

<p class='conformance'>OSLC AM Servers SHOULD support the Query Capabilities as defined by [[!OSLCCore3]] for both <code>oslc_am:Resource</code> and <code>oslc_am:LinkType</code> resources.</p>

<p class='conformance'>If the service provider supports query capability for <code>oslc_am:Resource</code> resources, it MUST support the following query parameters:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>oslc.where</code></li>
<li><code>oslc.searchTerms</code></li>
</ul>

<p class='conformance'>OSLC AM Servers SHOULD support query capability for <code>oslc_am:LinkType</code> resources. If supported then AM Servers MUST support a simple GET without any query parameters that returns all link type resources. AM Servers SHOULD support the full OSLC query syntax.</p>
</section>

<section id="delegatedUIs">
<h3>Delegated UIs</h3>

<p class='conformance'>OSLC AM Servers SHOULD support the selection of resources by delegated selection dialogs as defined by [[!OSLCCore3]].</p>

<p class='conformance'>OSLC AM Servers MAY support the creation of resources by delegated creation dialogs as defined by [[!OSLCCore3]].</p>

<p class='conformance'>In <code>oslc:Dialog</code> elements, the two optional child elements; <code>oslc:hintWidth</code> and <code>oslc:hintHeight</code> specify the suggested size of the dialog or frame to render the HTML content in. Expected size values are defined by <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS1/#length-units">CSS length units</a>.</p>
