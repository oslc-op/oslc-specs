<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This specification defines a vocabulary and resource shapes for OSLC
    Architecture Management resources. The intent is to define resources needed to
    support common integration scenarios and not to provide a comprehensive
    definition of an architecture resource. The resource formats are intended to define a high-level resource that can be specialized by enterprise architecture, analysis or design artifacts. The approach to supporting these
    scenarios is to delegate operations, as driven by service provider
    contributed user interfaces, as much as possible and not require a service
    provider to expose its complete data model and application logic.</p>


<section id="terminology" class='informative'>
<h1>Terminology</h1>
<p>Terminology is based on OSLC Core Overview [[!OSLCCore3]], W3C Linked Data
    Platform [[!LDP]], W3C's Architecture of the World Wide Web [[WEBARCH]],
    Hyper-text Transfer Protocol [[!HTTP11]]. Terminology for this specification is defined in part 1 of the multi-part specification.</p>

<section id="conventions">
<p><p>In addition to the namespace URIs and namespace prefixes <code>oslc</code>, <code>rdf</code>, <code>dcterms</code> and <code>foaf</code> defined in the <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/oslc-core/oslc-core/v3.0/oslc-core-v3.0-part1-overview.html">OSLC Core specification</a>, OSLC AM defines the namespace URI of <code>http://open-services.net/ns/am#</code> with a namespace prefix of <code>oslc_am</code></p>

<p>This specification also uses these namespace prefix definitions:</p>

<ul>
<li>oslc_rm : <code>http://open-services.net/ns/rm#</code> [[OSLCRM]]</li>
<li>oslc_qm : <code>http://open-services.net/ns/qm#</code> [[OSLCQM]]</li>
</ul>

<section id="amVocab">
  <h2>Architecture Management Vocabulary Terms</h2>
    <p>Property value types that are not defined in the following sections, are defined in [[!OSLCCore3]].</p>

<p>There are two OSLC AM defined resources: Resource and LinkType. OSLC AM defines a least common set of properties for resources, however service implementations are free to extend this set of properties. Clients <strong>MUST</strong> preserve properties it does not recognize when updating resources. AM Servers <strong>MAY</strong> ignore properties that it does not recognize. Additional properties may come from existing vocabularies (ie. Dublin Core, OWL). When additional properties do not come from a known vocabulary, it is recommended that they exist in their own unique namespace, and providers <strong>SHOULD NOT</strong> reuse namespaces defined in these specifications.</p>

<p>All RDF/XML resources that include links with annotations MUST begin with an outer <code>&lt;rdf:RDF&gt;</code> element. This outer XML element is required to support the ability to include annotations on &#8216;link&#8217; properties with additional <code>&lt;rdf:Description&gt;</code> elements <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax/#section-Syntax-reifying">reifying statements</a> about the link.</p>

<p>Service implementations and clients MUST be prepared to accept any form of valid RDF/XML. For example the following two resource forms are equivalent.</p>

<pre class="example">
&lt;rdf:RDF
   xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
   xmlns:oslc="http://open-services.net/ns/core#"
   xmlns:oslc_am="http://open-services.net/ns/am#"
   xmlns:dcterms="http://purl.org/dc/terms/"&gt;

    &lt;oslc_am:Resource rdf:about="https://acme.com/resources/res1"&gt;
      &lt;dcterms:title&gt;Service Interface&lt;/dcterms:title&gt;
      &lt;dcterms:identifier&gt;res1&lt;/dcterms:identifier&gt;
      &lt;oslc:serviceProvider rdf:resource="http://open-services.net/ns/am#"/&gt;
    &lt;/oslc_am:Resource&gt;
&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;

is equivalent to

&lt;rdf:RDF
   xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
   xmlns:oslc="http://open-services.net/ns/core#"
   xmlns:dcterms="http://purl.org/dc/terms/"&gt;

    &lt;rdf:Description rdf:about="https://acme.com/resources/res1"&gt;
      &lt;dcterms:title&gt;Service Interface&lt;/dcterms:title&gt;
      &lt;dcterms:identifier&gt;res1&lt;/dcterms:identifier&gt;
      &lt;rdf:type rdf:resource="http://open-services.net/ns/am#Resource" /&gt;
      &lt;oslc:serviceProvider rdf:resource="http://open-services.net/ns/am#"/&gt;
    &lt;/rdf:Description&gt;
&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;
</pre>

  <p>This specification defines a number of specific, commonly occurring vocabulary terms (OWL classes), properties and values. Servers may define additional classes and provide additional properties as needed.</p>

<section id="resourceConstraints">
<h2>Resource Constraints</h2>
<p>This section specifies the constraints for the Architecture Management resources. The resource properties are not limited to the ones defined
    in this specification, AM Servers may provide additional properties.
    It is recommended that any additional properties exist in their own unique
    namespace and not use the namespaces defined in these specifications.</p>

<section id="resource">
<h3>Resource: Resource</h3>
    <p>An Architecture Management Resource (AMR) is a generic resource format that can be used to represent any type of specific architecture resource such as a UML Class, Use Case, or Business Process Diagram.</p>

  <div title='Shapes for Architecture Management'
        data-include='./architecture-management-shapes.ttl#Resource'

        data-include-sync='true'
        data-include-replace='true'
        data-include-format='html'>
   </div>
</section>

<section id="linkType">
<h3>Resource: LinkType</h3>
  <p>A Link Type Resource (LTR) represents type of link that is or can be used when defining links from AM resources. The type has an ID (expressed as a string), whose universally accepted semantics may be defined elsewhere. This resource represents the definition as it is used by this service provider. This resource is meant as a convenience for clients to get a list of known/registered link types with human readable labels and definitions that can be used in client user interfaces when links are being created. </p>

  <p>The resource defines the properties rdfs:label and rdfs:comments for the link type URI. The link type URI is made type: <code>http://open-services.net/ns/am#LinkType</code> via an <code>rdf:type</code> property. The remaining properties may be properties of the link type URI, or on a separate resource managed by the service provider. In the case where the service provider owns the domain of the link type URI these can be the same, and all properties can be on the same link type URI.</p>

  <p>Links from AMR resources are managed in accordance with the <a href="https://tools.oasis-open.org/version-control/svn/oslc-core/trunk/supporting-docs/link-guidance.html">OSLC Core Guidance on Links and Relationships</a>. They appear as simple properties in the resource. Links MAY include inlined values for the target and MAY include anchor properties on the link itself. AM Servers SHOULD support LinkType Resources for clients to get a list of known and acceptable link properties.</p>
