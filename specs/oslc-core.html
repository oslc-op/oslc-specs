<h2>Introduction</h2>  

<p>Information Technology (IT) enterprises are constantly addressing demands
to do more with less. To meet this demand they need more efficient development
processes and supporting tools. This has resulted in strong demand for better
support of integrated system and software processes. Enterprises want
solutions (such as software or hardware development tools) from different
vendors, open source projects and their own proprietary components to work
together. This level of integration, however, can become quite challenging and
unmanageable. In order to enable integration between a heterogeneous set of
tools and components from various sources, there is a need for a sufficient
supporting architecture that is: loosely coupled, minimal, and has been
standardized. OSLC is based on World Wide Web and Linked Data principles, such
as those defined in the W3C Linked Data Platform (LDP), to create a cohesive
set of specifications that can enable products, services, and other
distributed network resources to interoperate successfully. [[LDP]]</p>

<p>OSLC is motivated by domain-driven scenarios that inspire standardization
of common capabilities across disciplines such as change management,
requirement management, and quality management, as well as by cross-domain
scenarios such as Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) &amp; DevOps, Product
Lifecycle Management (PLM), and Integrated Service Management (ISM). Though
the OSLC approach may apply to many other domains and cross-domain scenarios,
it focuses its efforts to ensure it meets a core set of scenarios and
requirements.</p>

<p>The OSLC Core specifications provide additional capabilities that expand on
the W3C LDP capabilities, as needed, to enable key integration scenarios. They
define the essential technical elements of OSLC domain specifications and
offers guidance on common concerns for creating, updating, retrieving, and
linking to lifecycle resources based on W3C LDP [[LDP]]. These specifications
have emerged from the best practices and other work of other OSLC Member
Section (MS)-affiliated Technical Committees (TCs), sometime referred to as
OSLC domain TCs.  OSLC domain TCs focus on a certain domain or topic. The <a
href="https://www.oasis-open.org/apps/org/workgroup/oslc-core/">OSLC Core
TC</a> develops technical specifications, creates best practices documents and
formulates design principles that can be leveraged by other OSLC MS-affiliated
TCs to enable them to focus on domain-specific concerns.</p>

  <figcaption>OSLC Core 3.0 Overview</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As seen in <a href="#fig-oslc-core-3.0-overview"></a>, there are a number
of capabilities developed in different standards organizations, TCs and
working groups.  The arrows represent either dependencies or extensions to
some specifications or capabilities.  OSLC MS-affiliated TC developed
specifications may depend on OSLC Core 3.0 specifications as scenarios
motivate. HOwever, a leading goal is to minimize and eliminate unnecessary
dependencies to simplify adoption, which may result in no dependency on OSLC
Core 3.0 specifications.</p>

<p>This work is an evolution from the OSLC Core 2.0 [[OSLCCore2]] efforts,
which takes the experience gained from that effort along with the common
foundation on W3C LDP, to produce an updated set of specifications that are:
simpler, built on layered capabilities and easier to adopt.</p>

		<section id='deprecatedterms'>
		<h2>Deprecated terms</h2>
		<p>In previous revisions of OSLC-based specifications [[OSLCCore2]],
			terminology used based that may longer be relevant, accurate or
			needed anymore. Some of those deprecated terms are:
		<dl class="glossary">
			<dt>Provider (<em>deprecated</em>)</dt>
			<dd>See Server [[HTTP11]].</dd>

			<dt>Consumer (<em>deprecated</em>)</dt>
			<dd>See Client [[HTTP11]].</dd>
		</dl>

	</section>

	<section class='informative'>
		<h2>Goals/Motivation</h2>


		<em class='loc-heading'>Scenario-driven</em>
		<p>Every capability should be linked back to
			key integration scenarios that motivate its need. These are important not only for knowing that the correct specification content is being developed but also to assist with implementers understanding the intended usage and in developing relevant test cases.</p>

		<em class='loc-heading'>Incremental</em>
		<p>Specifications should be developed in an incremental fashion
			that not only validates the technical approaches but also delivers
			integration value sooner.</p>

		<em class='loc-heading'>Loose-coupling</em>
		<p>Specifications should support a model where clients have little
			to no knowledge about server implementation-specific behaviors in
			order to support key integration scenarios. As a result, clients
			should be unaffected by any server application software
			or data model implementation changes. Similarly, client software should be able to be independently changed without changes to server software.</p>

		<em class='loc-heading'>Minimalistic</em>
		<p>Specification authors should strive to find not only the
			simplest solution that would work for a given scenario but allows for easy adoption. Authors should avoid solutions that offer additional capabilities which may inhibit adoption of necessary capabilities.</p>

		<em class='loc-heading'>Capability Based</em>
		<p>A capability is aligned by some related scenarios or technologies.
		    Capabilities should be defined to be as independent as possible. The capabilities should be incrementally defined as independent focused specifications and independently discovered at runtime. Even though there may be some generally agreed upon best practices for capability publication and discovery, each capability should define how it is published and discovered. The Core OSLC capabilities are defined in this specification.</p>

		<em class='loc-heading'>Vocabularies</em>
		<p>Various OSLC MS-affiliated TCs, or any specification development body that is authoring specifications for specific domains of knowledge, should minimally define vocabularies and the semantics behind the various terms.  Some consideration should be given for global reuse when terms are used for cross domain queries and within
		other domain resource shape definitions. Domain specifications are
		the definition of an OSLC capability, and how those vocabulary terms are used in LDP interactions by both the clients and servers of that capability. The specification should include defining resource shapes that describe resources based on a set of vocabulary terms, which introduces any domain specific constraints on the vocabulary's usage.
		Domain vocabulary terms should be developed with global reuse in mind.</p>
	</section>

	<section class='informative'>
		<h2>Architecture</h2>
		<p>In support of the previously stated goals and motivation, it is desired to have a consistent and recommended architecture. The architecture needs to support scenarios where there needs to be a protocol to access, create, update and delete resources: LDP is the foundation for this [[LDP]]. These resources need to relate, or link, to one another utilizing a consistent, standard and web-scale data model: Resource Description Framework (RDF) [[rdf11-concepts]] is the foundation for this. The ability to work with these data models over HTTP protocols, is based on [[LDP]].  </p>

		<p>Some scenarios, require the need to integrate user interface components: either within a desktop or mobile web-browser, mobile device application, or rich desktop applications.  For these scenarios, the technology is rapidly evolving and changing.  Priority should be based on existing standards such as HTML5, with use of <code>iframe</code> and <code>postMessage()</code>. [[HTML5]]</p>

		<p>Various OSLC Core specifications elaborate on the conformance requirements leveraging these various technologies and
		approaches.</p>

		<p>As the primary goals have been outlined around lifecycle integration, some scenarios may require exploration of new (or different) approaches and technologies.  As with all specification development efforts, the OSLC Core TC will advise, develop and approve
		such efforts through the established processes for cross-TC and organization coordination.</p>

	<section>
		<h2>OSLC Core 3.0 Capabilities</h2>
		<p>The following sections and referenced documents compose the capabilities for OSLC Core 3.0:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://tools.oasis-open.org/version-control/browse/wsvn/oslc-core/specs/discovery.html">Discovery</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://tools.oasis-open.org/version-control/browse/wsvn/oslc-core/specs/common-vocab.html">Common Vocabulary Terms</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://tools.oasis-open.org/version-control/browse/wsvn/oslc-core/specs/resource-preview.html">Resource Preview</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://tools.oasis-open.org/version-control/browse/wsvn/oslc-core/specs/dialogs-v3.html">Delegated Dialogs</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://tools.oasis-open.org/version-control/browse/wsvn/oslc-core/specs/attachments.html">Attachments</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://tools.oasis-open.org/version-control/browse/wsvn/oslc-core/supporting-docs/link-guidance.html">Link Guidance</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p>These documents comprise the multi-part specification for OSLC Core 3.0. They represent common capabilities that servers MAY provide and that may be discovered and used by clients. Although OSLC Core could be useful on its own, it is intended to specify capabilities that are common across many domains. Servers will generally specify conformance with specific domain specifications, and those domain specifications will describe what parts of OSLC Core are required for conformance. This allows servers to implement the capabilities they need in a standard way without the burden of implementing capabilities that are not required. The purpose of the OSLC Core Discovery capability is to allow clients to determine what capabilities are provided by a server. Any provided capability must meet all the conformance criteria for that capability as defined in the OSLC Core 3.0 specifications.</p>

		<p>This implies that any capability that is discoverable is essentially optional, and once discovered, the capability is provided as defined in the applicable OSLC specifications. Servers should support OSLC Discovery, but Discovery itself is also an optional capability as servers could provide other means of informing specific clients of supported OSLC capabilities that could be utilized directly. For example, a server might provide only preview dialogs on specific resources and nothing else.</p>

		<section id="authentication">
			<h2>Authentication</h2>
			<p>Authentication determines how a user of a client identifies themselves to a server to ensure the user has sufficient privileges to access resources from that server, and provides a mechanism for servers to control access to resources.
			</p>
			<section id="basic-auth"><h2 class="normalText">
				OSLC 3.0 servers MAY protect resources with HTTP Basic Authentication. OSLC Services that use HTTP Basic Authentication SHOULD do so only via SSL.
			</h2></section>
			<section id="oauth-auth"><h2 class="normalText">
				OSLC 3.0 servers SHOULD protect resources with [[rfc6749]] Authentication utilizing [[OpenIDConnect]]
			</h2></section>
		</section>
		<section id="resourceDiscovery">
			<h2>Resource Discovery and Representations</h2>
			<p>Resource <a href="http://tools.oasis-open.org/version-control/browse/wsvn/oslc-core/specs/discovery.html">Discovery</a> and Representations defines a common approach for HTTP/LDP-based servers to be able to publish their RESTful API capabilities and how clients can discover and use them. It also specifies the expected representations of resources defined by this specification.
		</section>
		<section id="commonVocabulary">
			<h2>Common Vocabulary</h2>
			<p><a href="http://tools.oasis-open.org/version-control/browse/wsvn/oslc-core/specs/common-vocab.html">Common Vocabulary Terms</a> defines a number of commonly used RDF vocabulary terms and resources (shapes), that have broad applicability across various domains.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="resourceOperations">
			<h2>Resource Operations</h2>
			<p>Resource Operations specify how clients create, read, update and delete resources managed by servers.</p>
			<section id="crudOperations"><h2 class="normalText">
				OSLC Services use HTTP for create, retrieve, update and delete operations on resources. OSLC Services MUST comply with the HTTP specification [[HTTP11]]. 
			</h2></section>	
			<section id="updatedOperation"><h2 class="normalText">
				Because the update process may involve first getting a resource, modifying it and then later putting it back to the server, there is the possibility of a conflict, e.g. some other client may have have updated the resource since the GET. To mitigate this problem, OSLC Services SHOULD use the HTTP <code>If-Match</code> header:
				<ul>
					<li>If the HTTP <code>If-Match</code> header is missing OSLC Services SHOULD return HTTP Bad Request (400) status code to indicate that the header is required.</li>
					<li>If the HTTP <code>If-Match</code> header is present OSLC Services MUST behave as described in the HTTP specification, returning an HTTP Precondition Failed (412) error to indicate that the header does not match.</li>
					<li>If the HTTP <code>If-Match</code> header is present and it matches, but there is some other problem or conflict with the update then OSLC Services MAY return an HTTP Conflict (409) to indicate that problem.</li>
				</ul> 		
			</h2></section>	
			<section id="selectiveProperties"><h2 class="normalText">
				OSLC Services MAY support a technique called <a href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OslcCoreSpecification#Selective_Property_Values">Selective Property Values</a> as defined in [[OSLCCore2]] to enable clients to retrieve only selected property values. This capability is included to preserve compatibility with [[OSLCCore2]].
			</h2></section>	
		</section>
		<section id="resourcePreview">
			<h2>Resource Preview</h2>
			<p><a href="http://tools.oasis-open.org/version-control/browse/wsvn/oslc-core/specs/resource-preview.html">Resource Preview</a> specifies a technique to get a minimal HTML representation of a resource identified by a URL. Applications often use this representation to display a link with a lable, or display a small or large preview when a user makes some gesture over a link.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="delegatedDialogs">
			<h2>Delegated Dialogs</h2>
			<p><a href="http://tools.oasis-open.org/version-control/browse/wsvn/oslc-core/specs/dialogs-v3.html">Delegated Dialogs</a> allow one application to embed a creation or selection UI into another using HTML <code>iframe</code> elements and JavaScript code. The embedded dialog notifies the parent page of events using HTML5 <code>postMessage</code>.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="query">
			<h2>Query</h2>
			<p>OSLC servers will often manage large amounts of potentially complex link-data entities. Practical use of this information will require some query capability that minimally supports selection, projection and ordering. Ideally OSLC Core would rely on existing standard query services such as [[SPARQL]] that are integrated with [[LDP]]. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/ldql/">Linked Data Query Lanaguage Community Group</a> is currently working on a Query Lanaguage for [[LDP]]. However, the reality is that many OSLC servers are adapters built on existing data management capabilities that are not built on an RDF foundation and do not provide SPARQL endpoints for query. In order to address the need for standard query capability to enable integration, [[OSLCCore2]] introduced a <a href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OSLCCoreSpecQuery">Query Capability</a> and a <a href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OSLCCoreSpecQuery">Query Syntax</a> that were intended to be simple enough that they could be implemented on a wide range of existing server architectures. In practice this has proven to be more difficult than anticipated. But the need is still there. OSLC Core 3.0 is built on [[LDP]] and future OSLC domain servers may provide more consistent access to SPARQL endpoints. Ofter time, that may lead to the deprecation of OSLC Core 2.0 Query Capability. In the meantime, OSLC Core 2.0 Query Capability is still available for OSLC domain specifications that need it.</p>
			<section id="queryCapability"><h2 class="normalText">
				OSLC Services MAY support a <a href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OslcCoreSpecification#Query_Capabilities">Query Capability</a> as defined in [[OSLCCore2]] to enable clients to perform selection and projection operations in order to retrieve a selected subest of resources and property values from an LDPC. For OSLC 3.0, every LDPC is considered an <code>oslc:queryBase</code>URI.  This capability is included to preserve compatibility with [[OSLCCore2]].

		</section>
		<section id="resourcePaging">
			<h2>Resource Paging</h2>
			<p>Resource Paging specificies a cability for servers to make the state of large resources available as a list of smaller subset resources (pages) whose representation is easier to produce by the server and consume by clients. Resource pageing is particularly useful in handling results from the query capability.</p>
			<section id="ldpPagingCapability"><h2 class="normalText">
