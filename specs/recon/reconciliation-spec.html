      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>(this section is informative)</p>

      <p>
        Reconciliation, as referenced in this specification, refers to the case where there exists a need to understand
        if multiple providers are referring to the same resource, particularly when there is not already a common
        identifier that all providers populate. For example, an IT environment discovery tool reports that it finds a
        computer using an IP address of 192.168.0.1 ; and a monitoring tools reports that CPU usage on the machine with
        hostname example1.domain.com. A system administrator would previously have to rely on experience or have to
        lookup manually that both tools are referring to the same physical resource. In HTTP terms, we want to determine
        that a set of URIs refer to the same “non-information resource” entity. See the
        <a
          href="https://archive.open-services.net/wiki/reconciliation/Reconciliation-Scenarios/index.html"
          title="Reconciliation-Scenarios"
          >Reconciliation Scenarios</a
        >
        page for several specific examples.
      </p>

      <p>
        This specification builds on the [[!OSLCCore2]] to define the resources and operations supported by Open
        Services for Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC) providers who have a need to reconcile resource instance information
        with other providers.
      </p>

      <p>
        The goal of this effort is to define resources, methods and constraints such that disparate tools can recognize
        that their data describes the same entity or concept (non-information resource). Reconcilable resources describe
        individual entities, including their relationships to other resources inside and/or outside of the
        Reconciliation domain.

        <p class="conformance">
          This specification is based on [[!OSLCCore2]]. OSLC Reconciliation domain consumers and service providers MUST
          be compliant with both the Core specification and this specification, and SHOULD follow all the guidelines and
          recommendations in both these specifications.
        </p>

        <p>
          The following table summarizes the requirements from OSLC Core Specification as well as additional
          requirements specific to the Reconciliation domain.
        </p>

        <p>
          Note that this specification further restricts some of the requirements from the OSLC Core Specification as
          noted in the Origin column of the compliance table. See further sections in this specification or the OSLC
          Core Specification to get further details on each of these requirements.
        </p>

        <p class="conformance">
          Any consumer or service provider behaviors are allowed unless explicitly prohibited by this or dependent
          specifications; conditional permissive requirements, especially those qualified with MAY, are implicitly
          covered by the preceding clause. While technically redundant in light of that broad permission, OSLC
          specifications do still make explicit MAY-qualified statements in cases where the editors believe doing so is
          likely to add clarity.

          Relationships to other resources are represented as properties whose values are the URI of the object or
          target resource. When a relationship property is to be presented in a user interface, it may be helpful to
          provide an informative and useful textual label for that relationship instance. (This in addition to the
          relationship property URI and the object resource URI, which are also candidates for presentation to a user.)
          [[!OSLCCore3]] Links Guidance allows OSLC providers to support a <code>dcterms:title</code> link property in
          resource representations, using the anchor approach (reification), but this specification discourages its use
          (providers SHOULD NOT use it, and consumers SHOULD NOT depend on it). At the time this specification was
          written, the W3C RDF working group was on a path to remove reification from the next version of RDF, and it
          was noted that reification never was normatively defined even in the RDF/XML syntax W3C Recommendation, where
          it occurs informatively.
