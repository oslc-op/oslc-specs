    <h2>Resource Definitions</h2>

    <p class=‘conformance’>Resources defined by this specification can have properties other than those described here, in any namespace. It
      is RECOMMENDED that any additional properties exist in their own unique namespace and not use the
      namespaces defined in this specification.</p>

    <p class=‘conformance’>A list of properties is defined for each type of resource. Most of these properties are identified in <a
        href="https://archive.open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OSLCCoreSpecAppendixA.html"> OSLC Core Appendix A: Common Properties</a> and in the
      <a href="https://archive.open-services.net/wiki/reconciliation/Common-IT-Resource-Type-Vocabulary-Version-2.0/index.html">Common IT Resource Type vocabulary</a>. Any
      exceptions are noted. Relationship properties refer to other resources. These resources may be in any OSLC domain
      (including the Reconciliation domain).</p>

    <p class=‘conformance’>For all resource types defined in this specification, all <strong>required</strong> properties (those defined
      with an occurrence of <strong>exactly-one</strong> or <strong>one-or-many</strong>) MUST exist
      for each resource and must be provided when requested. All other properties are optional, and might not exist on
      some or any resources; those that do not exist will not be present in the returned representation even if
      requested, while those that do exist MUST be provided if requested. Providers
      MAY define additional provider-specific properties; providers SHOULD use their
      own namespaces for such properties, or use standard Dublin Core or RDF namespaces and properties where
      appropriate.</p>

    <p class=‘conformance’>If no specific set of properties is requested, <strong>all</strong> properties MUST be returned
      - both those defined in this specification as well as any provider-specific ones. See <a
        href="https://archive.open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OslcCoreSpecification.html#Selective_Property_Values">Selective Property Values</a>
      in the OSLC Core Specification.</p>

    <p class=‘conformance’>Consumers should note that some resources may have a very large number of related resources, and that some
      resources may be very large and/or expensive to compute. For this reason, consumers are strongly
        RECOMMENDED to use the <code>oslc.properties</code> parameter to limit the properties returned from a
      request to the subset required. See <a
        href="https://archive.open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OslcCoreSpecification.html#Selective_Property_Values">Selective Property Values</a>
      in the OSLC Core Specification.</p>
