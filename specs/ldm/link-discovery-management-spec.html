        OSLC Link Discovery Management service defines an OSLC RESTful web services API for the discovering incoming and outgoing
        links to a set of optionally versioned resources. To support these scenarios, this specification defines a set of
        HTTP-based RESTful interfaces in terms of HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT and DELETE, as well as HTTP response
        codes, content type handling and resource formats.

    <section id="intro" class="informative">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        OSLC specifications do not currently specify where links between resources are stored, or which server owns
        which links. OSLC specifications also do not address which links are stored for properties that might be
        considered inverses such as implements and implementedBy. Some implementations may choose to store both of these
        links, other implementations may store typically the outgoing link and use OSLC Query or other mechanisms to get incoming links.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the introduction of OSLC Configuration Management, the simple technique of storing redundant backlinks
        becomes problematic for maintaining data consistency and is not recommended. Project Note 
        <a href="https://docs.oasis-open-projects.org/oslc-op/link-guidance/v1.0/link-guidance.html">
        OSLC Link Guidance</a> recommends storing
        the link on only one side and using some mechanism to query incoming links from the other direction. One
        approach in common practice is to use OSLC query where a client queries each of its related servers for incoming
        links. While this peer-to-peer query addresses the fundamental issues of getting incoming links without storing
        redundant backlinks, it does not scale or perform well in situations with more than a small number of related
        providers.
      </p>
      <p>
        A more scalable approach that has been practiced by several implementors such as IBM ELM and MID Smartfacts, is
        to manage a centralized link discovery service that enables OSLC clients to discover incoming links. For
        example, a requirements management (RM) application can display incoming links to specific requirement resources
        from test cases stored in a QM application. To an end user the incoming links are essential to carry out various
        lifecycle activities, such as understanding coverage and/or impact of a set of requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        OSLC link Discovery Management is an OSLC specification that defines a standard means for client applications to
        discover incoming and optionally outgoing links to/from resources. This specification follows existing practices for incoming links discovery
        and specifies the following services:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          How to inquire incoming and optionnally outgoing links to resources for a provided set of resource URIs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Incoming links service providers may operate in configuration enabled contexts, returning incoming and outgoing
          as concept URIs resolved to versions using a Configuration-Context.
        </li>
        <li>A means of discovering service providers that contribute links to an LDM server.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A common way of ingesting and maintaining a link index
        to support the inquiries uses already standardized OSLC Tracked Resource Sets [[OSLCTRS]]. However, this specification 
        does not specify how link discovery services ingest data from the various lifecycle providers,
        to support the link discovery services. LDM Server implementations may use any means for populating their required content. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This specification is a [[!OSLCCore3]] compliant specification, and as such most of its content are references
        to [[!OSLCCore3]].

          <dt>LDM Server</dt>
          <dd>
            A server implementing the OSLC Link Discovery Management specification. OSLC LDM clients consume services
            provided by LDM Servers to discover incoming links. The use of the terms Client and Server are intended to
            distinguish typical consumers and providers of OSLC resources in a distributed environment based on REST. A
            particular application component could be a client for some OSLC domain services and a server for the same
            or another domain.

          This specification is based on [[!OSLCCore3]]. An OSLC LDM Server MUST be compliant with both the core

                below, consider that instead of using oslc:nextPage in oslc:ResponseInfo, the use of oslc:postBody is
                required.

                URI are configured. This specification does not prescribe how these multiple LDM servers are managed
                together. A LDM Service SHOULD provide discovery of its link contributors via Service Provider Catalog
                which is pointing via <code>oslc:serviceProviderCatalog</code> to the contributing servers catalogs.

      <h2>LDM Service Description</h2>
      <h3>Discover links inquiry</h3>
      <p>
        LDM clients inquire for links related to a set of source resources, typically owned and/or
        visualized by the client. The discover links inquiry is exposed under the discover-links path as described in
        the open-API section below. For the links inquiry, the client provides:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Configuration Context: An optional URI of an OSLC configuration context for resolving concept URIs to version resources
        </li>
        <li>
          Resources: Zero or more URIs of source resources for which incoming links are being requested
        </li>
        <li>
          Link predicates: Zero or more URIs of OSLC link types (or RDF properties) that are being requested
        </li>
        <li>
          Direction: optional parameter indicating incoming or any links should be returned, incominig is the default
        </li>
        <li>
          AdditionalResourceProperties: URIs of additional properties the LDM Client is requesting the LDM Server return
          about the objects of the incoming links. This is a convenience for LDM Clients who might need additional
          information like title and icon to for example display incoming links, and avoids additionl resource GET requests.    
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="conformance">
        In case the Configuration Context is specified, any object or subject-resource MUST be specified based on
        concept resources. The server MUST respond with a set of triples for the links, which are valid for the
        given Configuration Context. In case the Configuration Context is not specified, any object or subject-resource
        MUST be specified based on unversioned resources. The server MUST respond with a set of triples for the
        links, which are not bound to any Configuration Context. In case no predicates are provided, the server MUST provide all incoming links
        irrespective of their predicate.
        </p>
        <p class="conformance">
        The optional direction parameter is assumed by default to be "incoming". If the value of Direction is "any" the LDM server MUST include incoming and
        outgoing links are  in the result.
        </p>
      </p>
      <p>
        The LDM Server response is a set of link triples consisting of
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Subject resource: URI
        </li>
        <li>
          Predicate: URI
          <p>
            should be one of the requested link predicates, in case specified
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Object resource: URI
          <p>
            should be one of requested Object concept resources
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="conformance">
        If the direction is "incoming", object resource should be one of requested Object concept resource. 
        If the direction is "any", the subject resource or object resource should match one of the resource URIs specified
      </p>
      <p class="conformance">
        In case of AdditionalResouceProperties predicates specified, LDM may return additional triples {subject, predicate, object} 
        where {subject} is one of the subjects in the link triples, and predicate is one of the 
        AdditionalResourceProperties predicates. LDM Servers MAY support some AdditionalResourceProperties. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Based on the LDM Server response, the LDM Client would typically show the incoming link with an inverse
        link label (e.g., “validated by” vs. “validates”), for incoming links.</p>
        <p class="conformance">
        The inquiry MUST be implemented as an HTTP POST request,
        where the target concept resources and the predicates are provided with the request body.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following LDM example illustrates an OSLC RM client that inquires incoming links to requirements req1 and
        req2 in configuration baseline1 with predicates oslc_cm:tracks and oslc_cm:implements
