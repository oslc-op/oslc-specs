        OSLC Link Discovery Management service defines an OSLC RESTful web services API for the discovering incoming
        links to a set of possibly versioned resources. To support these scenarios, this specification defines a set of
        HTTP-based RESTful interfaces in terms of HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT and DELETE, as well as HTTP response
        codes, content type handling and resource formats.

    <section id="intro" class="informative">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        OSLC specifications do not currently specify where links between resources are stored, or which server owns
        which links. OSLC specifications also do not address which links are stored for properties that might be
        considered inverses such as implements or implementedBy. Some implementations may choose to store both of these
        links, other implementations may store one link and use OSLC Query or other mechanisms to get incoming links.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the introduction of OSLC Configuration Management, the simple technique of storing redundant backlinks
        becomes problematic for maintaining data consistency is not recommended. OSLC Link Guidance recommends storing
        the link on only one side and using some mechanism to query incoming links from the other direction. One
        approach in common practice is to use OSLC query where a client queries each of its related servers for incoming
        links. While this peer-to-peer query addresses the fundamental issues of getting incoming links without storing
        redundant backlinks, it does not scale or perform well in situations with more than a small number of related
        providers.
      </p>
      <p>
        A more scalable approach that has been practiced by several implementors such as IBM ELM and MID Smartfacts, is
        to manage a centralized link discovery service that enables OSLC clients to discover incoming links. For
        example, a requirements management (RM) application can display incoming links to specific requirement resources
        from test cases stored in a QM application. To an end user the incoming links are essential to carry out various
        lifecycle activities, such as understanding coverage and/or impact of a set of requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        OSLC link Discovery Management is an OSLC specification defines a standard means for client applications to
        discover incoming links to resources. This specification follows existing practices for incoming links discovery
        and specifies the following services:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          How to inquire incoming links to versioned resources for a provided set of (displayed) concept resource URIs
          and a given configuration context
        </li>
        <li>
          Incoming links service providers operate in configuration enabled contexts. Therefore, the incoming link
          inquiries shall specify configuration contexts for the links
        </li>
        <li>A means of discovering service providers that contribute links to an LDM server.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The specification does not specify how link discovery services ingest data from the various lifecycle providers,
        in order to effectively support the inquiries. That said, a common way of ingesting and maintaining a link index
        to support the inquiries uses already standardized OSLC Tracked Resource Sets [OSLC-TRS-v3.0]
      </p>
      <p>
        This specification is a [[!OSLCCore3]] compliant specification, and as such most of its content are references
        to [[!OSLCCore3]].

        <h3>Terminology</h3>
        <dl class="spaced">
          <dt><dfn>Link</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
            An assertion or RDF triple consisting of a (subject, predicate, object) that manifests an instance of a
            relationship between the referenced subject and object.
          </dd>

          <dt>LDM Client</dt>
          <dd>
            An implementation of an application that consumes services provided by LDM servers to discover the scope of
            available links, and incoming links to a particular set of target resources.
          </dd>

          <dt>LDM Server</dt>
          <dd>
            A server implementing the OSLC Link Discovery Management specification. OSLC LDM clients consume services
            provided by LDM Servers to discover incoming links. The use of the terms Client and Server are intended to
            distinguish typical consumers and providers of OSLC resources in a distributed environment based on REST. A
            particular application component could be a client for some OSLC domain services and a server for the same
            or another domain.
          </dd>
          <dt>Concept Resource</dt>
          <dd>
            An artifact (a requirement, test case, source code file, etc.) as an overall entity, independent of any
            specific version of that artifact. In Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) systems, this is often referred to
            as a 'master' item or part, of which there are revisions and versions or iterations. As defined in
            [OSLC-Config-1.0-Part1]
          </dd>

          <dt>Versioned Resource</dt>
          <dd>
            The state (including the properties) of a concept resource can vary over time, or for other reasons. A
            versioned resource is a concept resource that keeps track of different states. A version resource is a
            resource that represents one specific state of a versioned resource. Not every past state is necessarily
            kept; a server may elide or discard states that are no longer referenced. As defined in
            [OSLC-Config-1.0-Part1]

        <p class="conformance">
          This specification is based on [[!OSLCCore3]]. OSLC LDM servers MUST be compliant with both the core

          from the OSLC Core Specification. See the previous sections in this specification or the OSLC Core
          Specification to get further details on each of these requirements.

                is supported, stable paging is required. Note: as the LDM server implements a post-method as defined
                below, consider that instead of using oslc:nextPage in oslc:ResponseInfo, the use of oslc:postBody is
                required.

                LDM Service URI is configured explicitly in each LDM client. Therefore no dedicated discovery protocol
                is needed. Note: a scenario with multiple LDM Servers is possible, in which case multiple LDM Service
                URI are configured. This specification does not prescribe how these multiple LDM servers are managed
                together. A LDM Service SHOULD provide discovery of its link contributors via Service Provider Catalog
                which is pointing via oslc:serviceProviderCatalog to the contributing servers catalogs.

      <h2>LDM Service Description</h2>
      <h3>Discover links inquiry</h3>
      <p>
        LDM clients inquire for incoming links related to a set of target object resources, typically owned and/or
        visualized by the client. The discover links inquiry is exposed under the discover-links path as described in
        the open-API section below For the incoming links inquiry, the client provides:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Configuration Context [0..1]: URI
        </li>
        <li>
          Object resource [0..*]: URI
        </li>
        <li>
          Incoming link predicates [0..*]: URI
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="conformance">
        In case the Configuration Context is specified, any object- or subject-resource shall be specified based on
        concept resources. The server MUST respond with a set of triples for the incoming links, which are valid for the
        given Configuration Context. In case the Configuration Context is not specified, any object- or subject-resource
        shall be specified based on unversioned resources. the server MUST respond with a set of triples for the
        incoming links, which are not bound to a Configuration Context. Rationale: to support bidirectionality for
        non-configuration aware links In case no predicates are provided, the server MUST provide all incoming links
        irrespective of their predicate.
      </p>
      <p>
        The LDM Server response is a set of triples consisting of
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Subject resource: URI
        </li>
        <li>
          Predicate: URI
          <p>
            should be one of the requested predicates, in case specified
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Object resource: URI
          <p>
            should be one of requested Object concept resources
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="conformance">
        Based on the LDM service response, the LDM client would typically show the incoming link with an inverse
        predicate label (e.g., “validated by” vs. “validates”). The inquiry MUST be implemented as an HTTP post request,
        where the target concept resources and the predicates are provided with the request body.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following LDM example illustrates an OSLC RM client that inquires incoming links to requirements req1 and
        req2 in configuration baseline1 with predicates oslc_cm:tracks and oslc_cm:implements
      </p>
      <pre class="example">
  POST http://ldm.example.com:8080/

      <h3>LDM contributions discovery</h3>
      <p>
        A LDM Service provides discovery of its link contributors via Service Provider Catalog which is pointing via
        oslc:serviceProviderCatalog to the contributing servers catalogs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The link contributions discovery is exposed under the root-services path as described in the open-API section
        below.
