In a distributed system, clients can lose race conditions that result in an &quot;available&quot;-appearing action's execution requests being rejected. It is likely that the target resource will be an oslc:Action, but that is not necessarily the case; when it is an oslc:Action, it will have at least one binding since this predicate's definition requires that the action be available when the response is formed."^^rdf:XMLLiteral .
