	<section id='abstract'>This document defines a high-level RDF vocabulary for specifying the
			<em>shape</em> of RDF resources. The shape of an RDF resource is a
			description of the set of triples it is expected to contain and the
			integrity constraints those triples are required to satisfy.
			Applications of shapes include validating RDF data, documenting RDF
			APIs, and providing metadata to tools, such as form and query
			builders, that handle RDF data.

	<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			Linked Data has proved to be an effective way to look up and navigate
			information at web scale. It is also emerging as a compelling
			architectural basis for web applications [[RWLD]]. The principles for designing Linked Data web
			applications are standardized by the W3C Linked Data
			Platform Specification 1.0 [[!LDP]].
		</p>

		<p>
			RDF is at the core of Linked Data. The design principles for Linked
			Data [[LDDI]] include the following rule:
		</p>
		<blockquote>When someone looks up a URI, provide useful
			information, using the standards (RDF*, SPARQL)
		</blockquote>

		<p>
			This emergence of RDF as an important application development
			technology for Linked Data and other domains has brought to light a
			serious gap in the associated technology stack, namely the absence of
			a way to describe the integrity constraints imposed by an application
			on the RDF documents it processes. Here the term <q>integrity
				constraint</q> denotes any characteristic of data required by or
			enforced by an application. Common examples of integrity constraints
			include the mandatory presence of properties, the cardinality of
			relations, and restrictions on the allowed values of properties.
		</p>

		<p>Well-established programming technologies such as relational
			databases, object-oriented programming languages, and XML utilize <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-world_assumption">closed-world assumptions</a> to provide
			schemas or type definitions that encode integrity constraints.
			Applications utilizing RDF and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-world_assumption">open-world assumptions</a> may need a similar mechanism to constrain the open-world for a particular context, and frequently
			start to use RDFS or OWL for this purpose. However, this is a
			misapplication of those technologies.</p>

			<p>RDFS and/or OWL are used to define OSLC vocabularies which specify the terms (classes and properties) and their semantic meaning. Vocabularies don't define constraints on what can be asserted, rather they define the meaning of what was asserted, often through the use of reasoners that introduce inferred assertions. However, there are also situations where a vocabulary needs to be constrained in order to be used in a specific context for a specific purpose. RDFS and OWL are often not useful for this purpose as unless the vocabularies are carefully designed, reasoners can introduce unintended assertions that are not consistent with the specified purpose.
			</p>

		<p>
			This document describes the Resource Shape specification, a
			high-level RDF vocabulary for describing the <em>shape</em> of RDF
			resources. Here the term <q>RDF resource</q> is used to denote an LDPR
			resource that has an RDF document among its set of available
			representations. The term <q>shape</q> is used because it is often
			useful to visualize an RDF document as a topological object, namely
			as a graph consisting of nodes interconnected by arcs. Throughout
			this document the terms <q>RDF resource</q>, <q>RDF document</q>, and
			<q>RDF graph</q> are used more or less interchangeably albeit
			somewhat imprecisely.
		</p>

		<p>The shape of an RDF graph includes both a description of its
			expected contents (properties, types) within some operational context
			(e.g. GET, POST) and the integrity constraints that must be satisfied
			by the contents in that context.</p>

		<p>Resource shapes specify a standard way of describing resources and constraints on resources that may be used in defining among other things, OSLC domain resources. There are other means that OSLC domains may use in addition to or instead of resource shapes such as W3C [[SHACL]] or [[JSONSchema]]. OSLC servers should describe their resources using resource shapes if they wish to integrate with [[!OSLCCore3]] clients or servers that are expecting resource shapes. OSLC domain specifications use shapes to specify the constraints on their domain vocabulary elements that must be supported by servers.</p>

		<p>This specification begins with a brief discussion of the use cases
			and requirements that the OSLC Resource Shape Specification addresses. It
			then describes all aspects of the current specification in detail.
			Finally, it concludes with some recommendations for extensions based
			on implementation experience.</p>

	<section id="terms">
		<h1>Terminology</h1>
		<p>Terminology uses and extends the terminology and capabilities of OSLC Core Overview [[!OSLCCore3]], W3C Linked Data Platform [[!LDP]], W3C's Architecture of the World Wide Web [[WEBARCH]],  Hyper-text
			Transfer Protocol [[!HTTP11]].</p>
			<p>This specification introduces the following terminology:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>applicability</dt>
				<dd>
					Shapes associated with a resource apply to that resource if the shape's <code>oslc:describes</code> property matches the type of the associated resource, or the shape has no <code>oslc:describes</code> property in which case it applies to all resources associated with that shape. For all shapes that "apply to" or describe an associated resource, that resource should satisfy the constraints defined by those shapes. See <a href="#associating-and-applying-shapes">Associating and Applying Shapes</a> for the definition of how shapes are associated with resources, what associated shapes apply to a resource, and what it means if multiple shapes apply to a single resource.
				</dd>

				<dt>association</dt>
				<dd>
					This specification defines three contexts in which a shape may become
					associated with a described resource. The described resource itself
					may link to a shape using the property <a href="#instanceShape">oslc:instanceShape</a>,
				    the described resource may be the entity request to or response from a
					REST service whose service description links to a shape using the
					property <a href="#resourceShape">oslc:resourceShape</a>, or the resource may be the object value of an rdf:Property whose applicable <a href="#valueShape">oslc:valueShape</a> links to the constraining shape. More than
					one shape may become associated with a described resource in a
					given context. The shapes associated with a resource are the set of shapes to be checked for applicability. Not all the associated shapes are necessarily
					applicable. Refer to the definition of applicability above.
				</dd>

				<dt>datatype property</dt>
				<dd>A datatype property is a defined property that takes
					literal values.</dd>

				<dt>defined property</dt>
				<dd>
					A defined property is a property, such as dcterm:description or
					oslc_cm:status, of a described resource that is defined by some
					shape applicable to the described resource in a given context. A
					shape is linked to its defined properties using the property <a href="#property">oslc:property</a>. A described resource type
					might have a given defined property in some contexts but not in
					others. For example, the body of a POST request might have fewer
					defined properties than the created resource.
				</dd>

				<dt>described resource</dt>
				<dd>A described resource is a resource described by some shape.</dd>

				<dt>document</dt>
				<dd>A representation of a resource. For example, an RDF
					document may represent a resource.</dd>

				<dt>graph</dt>
				<dd>An RDF document may be regarded as a directed, labeled
					multi-graph, or, simply, a graph, in which each triple of the
					document corresponds to an arc of the graph. For each arc in the graph, the source
					is the subject of its triple, the target is the object of
					its triple, and the label is the predicate of its triple.</dd>

				<dt>object property</dt>
				<dd>An object property is a defined property that links to a
					resource, referred to as the object resource.</dd>

				<dt>object resource</dt>
				<dd>The object resource is the resource that is linked to by an
					object property.</dd>

				<dt>shape</dt>
				<dd>
					A resource of type <a href="#resourceShape">oslc:ResourceShape</a>
					that describes the contents of and constraints on some set of
					described resources.
				</dd>

	<section id='use-cases' class='informative'>
	<h2>Motivation</h2>
		<p>
			This section briefly describes the main use cases that motivate an RDF graph
			shape language. For a more complete discussion of this topic, refer
			to the W3C RDF Validation Workshop [[RDFVAL]].
		</p>

		<section id='describing-apis' class='informative'>
		<h2>Describing RDF APIs</h2>
			<p>Any application that provides programmatic services should
				also provide application programming interface (API) documentation
				to programmers so that they can consume those services. Applications
				that process RDF, including Linked Data web applications, are no
				different than other applications in this respect.</p>

			<p>Although API documentation is normally directed towards human
				programmers, there are also important use cases where other programs
				need to understand the API. For example, consider a generic
				form-building tool that can generate a user interface for creating
				or updating resources. Such a tool needs to understand the expected
				contents of the resource so it can generate a user interface. It
				also needs to understand the applicable integrity constraints so it
				can validate user input before sending it to the service provider or server.
				Furthermore, the server may apply different constraints for
				creation versus update operations.</p>
		</section>

		<section id="describing-datasets" class='informative'>
		<h2>Describing RDF Datasets</h2>
			<p>Users must understand the contents of an RDF dataset in order
				to write SPARQL queries. Understanding the integrity constraints can
				help users write better SPARQL queries. For example, if a property
				is known to always be present, then there is no need to wrap it in
				an OPTIONAL clause.</p>

			<p>Query building tools can take advantage of shape information.
				For example, consider a query builder that allows the user to define
				a query that filters results by selecting allowed values from a
				list. In principle, the query builder could dynamically query the
				dataset to determine the list of values present. However, such a
				query could be slow if the dataset was large. In addition, only
				those values present at the time of the query would appear in the
				list. In contrast, if the query builder had access to shape
				information, then it could avoid the potentially expensive query and
				present the user with the complete list of allowed values, whether
				or not they were actually present in the dataset at that time.</p>
		</section>

		<section id="describing-indexable-data" class='informative'>
		<h2>Describing Indexable Data</h2>
			<p>Resource indexers may be looking for certain types of
				structured data. For example, a web crawler might be indexing
				product descriptions and pricing for a marketplace application. The
				web crawler could provide a shape to describe the data it is looking
				for. Web application developers would then be able to provide that
				information in the web pages of their commerce site and thereby have
				their sites included in the index.</p>
		</section>
	</section>

	<section id="requirements" class='informative'>
	<h2>Requirements</h2>
		<p>This section describes some high-level requirements for an RDF
			resource shape language. For simplicity, members of a shape language
			are referred to as shape resources. It is to be understood that the
			validity and meaning of a shape resource depends on any other shape
			resources it is linked to.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>A shape language must be able to express the most commonly
				occurring aspects of RDF resources in high-level terms, using
				familiar concepts. Interested parties must be able to
				both understand existing shapes and author new ones.</li>
			<li>A shape resource must be processable using readily available
				RDF technologies. These include RDF parsers and SPARQL processors.</li>
			<li>The constraints defined by a shape resource must be
				verifiable using commonly available technologies, with acceptable
				performance. The performance criteria depend on the use case. For
				example, a tool checking user input must respond quickly. A tool
				validating an entire dataset may run as a batch job, but should
				complete within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. hours, not years).</li>
			<li>A shape language must be extensible so that
				application-specific aspects of resources can be expressed. A
				trade-off of expressiveness at the expense of ease-of-understanding
				is acceptable.</li>
			<li>It must be possible to apply different shapes to the same resources in different contexts in order to use the resources for different purposes.</li>
		</ol>

			This section describes the Resource Shape specification (aka
			the <em>Shapes</em> specification) which is part of [[!OSLCCore3]]. The
			Shapes specification defines:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>the contents and meaning of shape resources, and</li>
			<li>how to associate shape resources with resources and services</li>
		</ul>

		<section  id="overview" class='informative'>
		<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>
				A resource shape is a resource that describes the contents of, and
				constraints on, the RDF representation of other resources. These constraints are intended to be applicable to OSLC core and domain vocabularies in order to express the domains sufficiently to support interoperability between clients and servers that use and support them. Resource shapes specify the minimum an implementation needs to do be considered compliant. Specifically, shape constraints say how OSLC clients and servers must behave if the resources satisfy the applicable shape constraints, but they do not say what clients and servers may do if the applicable constraints are not satisfied.  
			</p> 
			<p>A shape
				resource itself has an RDF representation which uses the terms
				defined by the oslc: vocabulary. The term <q>shape resource</q> or
				simply <q>shape</q> is sometimes used as shorthand for the more
				verbose phrase <q>the RDF representation of a shape resource</q>
				where this can lead to no confusion. The following sections describe
				all of the RDF vocabulary terms used in shape resources.
			</p>

			<p>
				The Shapes specification is based on a simple conceptual model of
				resources that works well in practice, but is somewhat biased
				towards the view that the RDF representation of a resource looks
				like a set of property-value pairs on that resource. The Shapes
				specification works well when the resource being described appears
				as a subject node in its RDF graph and all other nodes are connected
				to the resource node by a path consisting of one or more properties.
				Each property-value pair is represented by a triple in which the
				subject is the resource, the predicate is the property, and the
				object is the value. The value may be either a literal or a
				resource. When the object is a resource, that resource may itself be
				described by another shape. Thus the Shapes specification is
				powerful enough to describe complex graphs. Although the Shapes
				specification works well in practice, it cannot describe arbitrary
				RDF graphs.
			</p>

			<p>The following diagram summarizes the main concepts and
				relations used in this specification:</p>
			<figure> <img src="images/shapes-overview.png" height="305" width="640" alt=""> <figcaption>Diagram of main concepts and relations.</figcaption> </figure>
			<p>In this diagram the boxes represent resource types and the
				arrows represent the relations between them that are defined by the
				Shapes specification. The two boxes on the left represent external
				types of resources that use shapes. The other three boxes represent
				the resource types that are defined by the Shapes specification.</p>
			<p>
				The box labeled <q>Resource Shape</q> represents a shape. A shape
				is a resource of <code>rdf:type</code> <a href="#resourceShape-shape">oslc:ResourceShape</a>.
				A shape describes a set of resources. A shape is basically a set of
				one or more defined properties that any resource described by that shape is expected to
				contain.
			</p>

			<p>
				The box labeled <q>Property</q> represents a defined property. A
				defined property is a resource of rdf:type <a href="#property-shape">oslc:Property</a>.
				The arrow labeled <q>property</q> represents the aggregation
				relation between a shape and its defined properties. The predicate
				of this relation is <a href="#property">oslc:property</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Each <a href="#property-shape">oslc:Property</a> resource has a set of
				properties that describe the defined property and the constraints on its use within any resource that the given shape applies to. These include a
				description of the values of the defined property and the number of its occurrences or cardinality
				within the resource. The value of a defined property may be a
				literal, a resource, or either. If the value of a defined property
				is a resource, then defined property may refer to another <a href="#resourceShape-shape">oslc:ResourceShape</a> resource that
				describes the value resource. This relation is depicted by the arrow
				labeled <q>valueShape</q>. The predicate of this relation is <a href="#valueShape">oslc:valueShape</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The value of a defined property may be constrained to take one of an
				allowed set of values. In some cases, the allowed set of values may
				be large and be used in many shapes. In this case it is useful to
				put the allowed values in a separate resource so they can be easily
				reused. The box labeled <q>Allowed Values</q> represents a resource
				of rdf:type <a href="#allowedValues-shape">oslc:AllowedValues</a>. The
				arrow labeled <q>allowedValues</q> represents the relation between
				a defined property and its set of allowed values. The predicate of
				this relation is <a href="#allowedValues">oslc:allowedValues</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				A [[REST]] service may describe aspects of
				its interface contract using shapes. For example, a REST service may
				provide a URI where new resources can be created via HTTP POST. This
				service could describe the expected contents of POST request bodies
				using shapes. Similarly, a REST service may provide a URI that
				represents a container of resources and could describe those
				resources using shapes. The box labeled <q>any service</q>
				represents any REST service description. The arrow labeled <q>resourceShape</q>
				represents the predicate <a href="#resourceShape">oslc:resourceShape</a>
				which is a property of the service description resource.
			</p>
			<p>
				Similarly, any resource can describe its own contents by linking to
				a shape resource. The box labeled <q>any resource</q> represents
				any resource. The arrow labeled <q>instanceShape</q> represents the
				predicate <a href="#instanceShape">oslc:instanceShape</a> which is a
				property of the resource.

		<h2>Associating and Applying Shapes</h2>
			<p>
				In general, the relation between shapes and resources is many-to-many.
				Given a resource R there <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> be zero or
				more shapes S associated with it. This specification defines three ways to associate shapes with a
				resource, namely using <a href="#instanceShape">oslc:instanceShape</a>,
				<a href="#resourceShape">oslc:resourceShape</a>, and <a href="#valueShape">oslc:valueShape</a>. Other specifications <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> define additional mechanisms. 
				<ol>
				  <li>Resource <code>oslc:instanceShape</code> ResourceShape - directly associates a constraining shape with a resource.</li>
				  <li>Service <code>oslc:resourceShape</code> ResourceShape - associates a constraining shape with the entity request or response resource of a service (e.g., a creation or query service).</li>
				  <li>Property <code>oslc:valueShape</code> ResourceShape - associates a constraining shape with the resource that is the object value of a property of a resource.</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<p>
				Not all shapes associated with a resource are necessarily applicable
				to it. Let S be associated with R. S is said to <em>apply</em> to R
				in the following two cases:
			</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Case 1: Generic Shape</dt>
				<dd>
					S applies to R when S has no <a href="#describes">oslc:describes</a>
					properties, in which case it is a generic shape and applies to any
					associated resource.
				</dd>
				<dt>Case 2: Typed Shape</dt>
				<dd>
					S applies to R when S is linked via <a href="#describes">oslc:describes</a>
					to an rdf:type T and R has rdf:type T.
				</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>If no shapes are associated with a resource then there are no
				implied constraints on that resource.</p>
			<p>
				If one or more shapes are associated with a resource then at least
				one of those <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> be applicable to
				that resource. If no associated shape applies to a resource then
				this <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> normally be interpreted as
				an error condition.
			</p>
			<p>
				If exactly one shape applies to a resource then that resource <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> satisfy all the constraints defined
				by that shape.
			</p>
			<p>
				If more than one shape applies to a resource then that resource <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> satisfy all the constraints defined
				by all the shapes (AND semantics). However, the specification for a
				service description <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> define
				alternate semantics. For example, a service <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span>
				require that the resource satisfy the constraints defined by at
				least one of the shapes (OR semantics).
			</p>
			<p>If a resource satisfies its applicable shapes, client and server implementations MUST behave as described in the defining OSLC specifications. If a resource does not satisfy its applicable shapes, implementations SHOULD attempt to complete the operation with the given data if possible. Otherwise implementations MAY reject the operation.</p>

				Property tables are used below to describe the resources defined by
				the Shapes specification, namely <a href="#resourceShape">oslc:ResourceShape</a>,
				<a href="#property-shape">oslc:Property</a>, and <a href="#allowedValues-shape">oslc:AllowedValues</a>.
				A property table is a tabular depiction of a subset of the
				information that can be specified using shapes. Each table describes
				one type of resource. Each row describes one property of the
				resource. Each column describes some aspect of the properties. The
				columns have the following meanings:
			</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><i>Prefixed Name</i></dt>
				<dd>
					The compact IRI [<a href="#IRI">IRI</a>] of the defined property
					being described in the current row of the table. This corresponds
					to the <a href="#propertyDefinition">oslc:propertyDefinition</a>
					property.
				</dd>

				<dt><i>Occurs</i></dt>
				<dd>
					The number of times the defined property may occur. This
					corresponds to the <a href="#occurs">oslc:occurs</a> property. This
					property may have one of the values <a
						href="#Exactly-one">oslc:Exactly-one</a>, <a href="#One-or-many">oslc:One-or-many</a>,
					<a href="#Zero-or-many">oslc:Zero-or-many</a>, and <a

				</dd>

				<dt><i>Read-Only</i></dt>
				<dd>
					<code>true</code> if the property is read-only. If omitted, or set to false, then the property is writable. Servers SHOULD declare a property read-only when changes to the value of that property will not be accepted after the resource has been created, e.g. on PUT/PATCH requests. Clients should note that the converse does not apply: Servers MAY reject a change to the value of a writable property.
				</dd>

				<dt><i>Value-Type</i></dt>
				<dd>
					The type of the values of the defined property. This corresponds to
					the <a href="#valueType">oslc:valueType</a> property. A defined
					property that takes literal values is called a <em>datatype
						property</em>. A defined property that links to another resource is
					called an <em>object property</em>. The resource linked to is
					called the <em>object resource</em>. For datatype properties, this
					property gives the datatype URI of the literal values. For object
					properties, this property specifies whether the object resource has
					a URI (Resource), is a blank node (LocalResource), or is any
					resource (AnyResource). These values correspond to <a
						href="#Resource">oslc:Resource</a>, <a href="#LocalResource">oslc:LocalResource</a>,
					and <a href="#AnyResource">oslc:AnyResource</a>.
				</dd>

				<dt><i>Representation</i></dt>
				<dd>
					For object properties, the location of the representation of the
					object resource. This corresponds to the <a href="#representation">oslc:representation</a>
					property. The representation of the object resource may be
					contained in the same document as the described resource (Inline),
					or it may be contained in a remote document (Reference), or it may
					be either (Either). These values correspond to <a href="#Inline">oslc:Inline</a>,
					<a href="#Reference">oslc:Reference</a>, and <a href="#Either">oslc:Either</a>. Domain vocabulary designers should carefully consider restrictions on representations, such as requiring <a href="#Reference">oslc:Reference</a>instead of <a href="#Either">oslc:Either</a>, in order to provide maximum flexibility.
				</dd>

				<dt><i>Range</i></dt>
				<dd>
					For object properties, the allowed rdf:type(s) of the object
					resources. This corresponds to the <a href="#range">oslc:range</a>
					property. This value may be Any if any type is allowed. The value
					Any corresponds to <a href="#Any">oslc:Any</a>.
				</dd>

				<dt><i>Description</i></dt>
				<dd>
					A description of the defined property. This corresponds to the <a

				<code>oslc:name</code> is used to specify the local name of the defined property.
				This is normally the portion of the defined property URI (see <a
					href="#propertyDefinition">oslc:propertyDefinition</a>) that
				follows the last hash (#) or slash (/).
			</p>
		</div>

		<h3 id="maxSize">oslc:maxSize Property</h3>
		<div>
			<p>For datatype properties whose type is <code>xsd:string</code>, <code>oslc:maxSize</code>
				specifies the maximum number of characters in the defined property
				value. The absence of oslc:maxSize indicates that either there is no
				maximum size or that the maximum size is specified some other way.</p>
		</div>

		<h3 id="occurs">oslc:occurs Property</h3>
		<div>
			<p>
				<code>oslc:occurs</code> is used to specify the number of times that the defined
				property may occur. The value of this property <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>
				be one of the following individuals:
			</p>

			<dl>
				<dt id="Exactly-one">oslc:Exactly-one</dt>
				<dd>
					The defined property <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> occur
					exactly once. It is required and single-valued.
				</dd>
				<dt id="One-or-many">oslc:One-or-many</dt>
				<dd>
					The defined property <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> occur at
					least once. It is required and multi-valued.
				</dd>
				<dt id="Zero-or-many">oslc:Zero-or-many</dt>
				<dd>
					The defined property <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> occur any
					number of times. It is optional and multi-valued.
				</dd>
				<dt id="Zero-or-one">oslc:Zero-or-one</dt>
				<dd>
					The defined property <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> occur no
					more than once. It is optional and single-valued.
				</dd>
				<p>For strings and language-tagged strings, single-valued means there is at most one value for any given language tag, and at most one untagged value.</p>
			</dl>
		</div>

		<h3 id="propertyDefinition">oslc:propertyDefinition Property</h3>
		<div>
			<p><code>oslc:propertyDefinition</code> is used to specify the URI of the the
				defined property.</p>
		</div>

		<h3 id="range">oslc:range Property</h3>
		<div>
			<p>
				<code>oslc:range</code> <span class="rfc2119">MUST NOT</span> be used with
				datatype properties. It <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> be used
				with object properties. For object properties, <code>oslc:range</code> is used to
				specify the allowed <code>rdf:type</code>s of the object resource.
				The target resource SHOULD be any of the specified <code>oslc:range</code> types, but no inferencing is intended if the actual target resource is or is not one of these types. This is very different semantics than <code>rdfs:range</code> which does have inferencing implications.</p>
				<p>The values of this property <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> be any rdf:type URI
				or the following individual:
			</p>
			<dl>
				<dt id="Any">oslc:Any</dt>
				<dd>This value specifies that there is no constraint on the
					type of the object resource.</dd>
			</dl>
		</div>

		<h3 id="readOnly">oslc:readOnly Property</h3>
		<div>
			<p>
				If present and true, <code>oslc:readOnly</code> is used to specify that the value
				of defined property is managed by the service, i.e. that it is
				read-only. It cannot be directly modified by clients of the
				service. Services <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> ignore
				attempts to modify read-only properties, but <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span>
				fail such requests. If a service ignores an attempt to modify a
				read-only property then it <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD NOT</span>
				do so silently. A service <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> use the
				HTTP Warning header or some other means to indicate that the attempt
				to modify a read-only property has been ignored.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this context, modification means a change in any object of the
				triples associated with the defined property. For example, a GET
				request followed by a PUT request would not modify the triples. A
				service <span class="rfc2119">MUST NOT</span> interpret a PUT
				request that does not modify the triples associated with the defined
				property as a violation of the oslc:readOnly constraint.
			</p>
			<p>Examples of read-only properties include creation and
				modification timestamps, the identity of who created or modified the
				described resource, and properties computed from the values of other
				properties.</p>
			<p>When modifying a resource, it is natural for a client to
				first retrieve its current representation using a GET request. This
				request will return read-only properties along with read-write
				properties. If a service fails PUT requests that contain read-only
				properties then clients will have to remove all read-only
				properties before submitting PUT requests. The behavior of ignoring
				read-only properties in PUT requests is therefore more convenient
				for clients. Similarly, when copying a resource, a client would
				GET it first. It is therefore more convenient for clients if the
				service ignores read-only properties also in POST requests.</p>
		</div>

		<h3 id="representation">oslc:representation Property</h3>
		<div>
			<p>
				For object properties, <code>oslc:representation</code> is used to specify how
				the object resource is represented. The value of <code>oslc:representation</code>
				<span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be one of the following
				individuals:
			</p>
			<dl>
				<dt id="Either">oslc:Either</dt>
				<dd>There is no constraint on the representation of the object
					resource.</dd>
				<dt id="Inline">oslc:Inline</dt>
				<dd>
					The representation of the object resource <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>
					be present in the representation of the described resource.
				</dd>
				<dt id="Reference">oslc:Reference</dt>
				<dd>
					The representation of the object resource <span class="rfc2119">MUST
						NOT</span> be present in the representation of the described resource.
				</dd>
			</dl>
		</div>

		<h3 id="valueShape">oslc:valueShape Property</h3>
		<div>
			<p>For object properties, <code>oslc:valueShape</code> is used to specify a
				link to resource shape that describes the object resource.</p>
		</div>

		<h3 id="valueType">oslc:valueType Property</h3>
		<div>
			<h4 id="literal-value-types">Literal Value Types</h4>
			<div>
				<p>
					For datatype properties, <code>oslc:valueType</code> specifies the literal value
					type. OSLC datatype properties are a subset of the base or primitive types defined by <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax/">RDF</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-1/">XML Schema</a>. A datatype <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be one of the following
					individuals:
				</p>

				<dl>
					<dt>rdf:XMLLiteral</dt>
					<dd>An XML fragment.</dd>
					<dt>xsd:boolean</dt>
					<dd>A boolean.</dd>
					<dt>xsd:dateTime</dt>
					<dd>A date-time.</dd>
					<dt>xsd:decimal</dt>
					<dd>A decimal number.</dd>
					<dt>xsd:double</dt>
					<dd>A double precision floating point number.</dd>
					<dt>xsd:float</dt>
					<dd>A single precision floating point number.</dd>
					<dt>xsd:integer</dt>
					<dd>An integer.</dd>
					<dt>xsd:string</dt>
					<dd>A string.</dd>
          <dt>rdf:langString</dt>
          <dd>A string with a language tag. Unless otherwise specified, anywhere OSLC uses xsd:string, rdf:langString may also be used.</dd>
				</dl>
			</div>

			<h4 id="resource-value-types">Resource Value Types</h4>
			<div>
				<p>
					For object properties, <code>oslc:valueType</code> specifies how the object
					resource is identified. It <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be one
					of the following individuals:
				</p>
				<dl>
					<dt id="AnyResource">oslc:AnyResource</dt>
					<dd>
						The object resource <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be
						identified with either a URI or a blank node.
					</dd>
					<dt id="LocalResource">oslc:LocalResource</dt>
					<dd>
						The object resource <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be
						identified with a blank node. The term <q>local resource</q> is
						used because the scope of identifier is local to the
						representation.
					</dd>
					<dt id="Resource">oslc:Resource</dt>
					<dd>
						The object resource <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be
						identified with a URI.

  <p>In addition, the OSLC Core TC would like to call out special recognition of the significant contribution by the originators of the Resource Shape concepts. The OSLC Resource Shape specification was
    initially developed by the OSLC Reporting Workgroup under the
    leadership of Tack Tong (IBM), with major contributions from Arthur
    Ryman (IBM) and Martin Nally (IBM). Members of OSLC workgroups found
    shapes to be applicable to other aspects of OSLC and so the
    specification was subsequently integrated into the OSLC Core
    specification by Dave Johnson (IBM).</p>

  <p>
    Anamitra Bhattacharyya (IBM) provided valuable feedback based on
    implementation experience and input on datatype facets. Steve Speicher (IBM)
    and John Arwe (IBM) contributed proposals for extending shapes which has informed the [[SHACL]] work.
