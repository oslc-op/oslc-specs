      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        This specification defines resource shapes for the OSLC Requirements Management resources. The intent is to
        define resources needed to support common integration scenarios and not to provide a comprehensive definition of
        a Requirement. The resource formats may not match exactly the native models supported by requirement management
        service providers, but are intended to be compatible with them. The approach to supporting these scenarios is to
        delegate operations, as driven by service provider contributed user interfaces, as much as possible and not
        require a service provider to expose its complete data model and application logic.
      </p>

        <h1>Terminology</h1>

          Architecture of the World Wide Web [[WEBARCH]], Hyper-text Transfer Protocol [[!HTTP11]]. Terminology for this
          specification is defined in part 1 of the multi-part specification.

          The constraints on the Requirement resource properties are defined in the tables below. Requirement resource
          properties are not limited to the ones defined in this specification. Service providers may provide additional
          properties. It is strongly recommended that any additional properties be defined in XML namespaces distinct
          from those defined by OSLC in these specifications. Requirement creation through a Creation Factory resource
          in the Service Description is REQUIRED by this specification.

        <p>
          Any <strong>resource</strong> asserted to be of <code>rdf:type</code>
          <code>http://open-services.net/ns/rm#Requirement</code> MUST conform to the constraints and meaning of
          properties defined below. Notice that partial representations of a requirement resource are admitted by this
          specification (for example, in query results, or where <code>oslc.properties</code> has been used), and such
          partial representations will in general not conform to these constraints.

    <section id="relationshipProperties" class="informative">
      <h2>Relationship Properties</h2>
      <p>
        For compatibility with OSLC Core 2.0 [[!OSLCCore2]], RM servers MAY accept relationship properties. This is
        however no longer recommended practice, since the necessary reification of relationship can have entailment and
        inferencing issues. OSLC Core 3.0 Link Guidance [[!OSLCCore3LinkGuidance]] details an alternative approach,
        where a separate resource is created to represent the relationship and its properties.

        <h3>Relationship labels</h3>
        <p>
          When an RM relationship property is to be presented in a user interface, it may be helpful to provide an
          informative and useful textual label for that relationship instance. (This in addition to the relationship
          property URI and the object resource URI, which are also candidates for presentation to a user.) To this end,
          OSLC Servers MAY suppport a <code>dcterms:title</code> link property in RM resource representations where a
          relationship property is permitted, using the anchor approach outlined in the OSLC Core Links Guidance.
        </p>

        <p>
          Servers and Clients should be aware that the <code>dcterms:title</code> of a link is unrelated to the
          dcterms:title of the object resource. Indeed, links may carry other properties with names in common to the
          object of the link, but there is no specified relationship between these property values.
