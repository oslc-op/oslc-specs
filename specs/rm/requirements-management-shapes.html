      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        This specification defines resource shapes for the OSLC Requirements Management resources. The intent is to
        define resources needed to support common integration scenarios and not to provide a comprehensive definition of
        a Requirement. The resource formats may not match exactly the native models supported by requirement management
        service providers, but are intended to be compatible with them. The approach to supporting these scenarios is to
        delegate operations, as driven by service provider contributed user interfaces, as much as possible and not
        require a service provider to expose its complete data model and application logic.
      </p>

      <section id="terminology" class="informative">
        <h1>Terminology</h1>
        <p>
          Terminology is based on OSLC Core Overview [[!OSLCCore3]], W3C Linked Data Platform [[!LDP]], W3C's
          Architecture of the World Wide Web [[WEBARCH]], Hyper-text Transfer Protocol [[!HTTP11]]. Terminology for this
          specification is defined in part 1 of the multi-part specification.

          informative and useful textual label for that relationship instance. (This in addition to the relationship
          property URI and the object resource URI, which are also candidates for presentation to a user.)
