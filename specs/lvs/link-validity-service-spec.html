        OSLC Link Validity Service defines an OSLC RESTful web service API to query, assess and assert the validity
        status of links that represent some semantic dependency.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        A Link Validity Service would provide the ability for a client application to set and query the status of links that
        represent some semantic relationship. See OSLC Core Version 3.0. Part 7: Vocabulary section 5.2 Traceability and
        Impact type.
      </p>
      <p>
        A Link Validity Service would provide a way for client applications to set and obtain the validity status of a link. 
        Validity status can be valid, suspect or invalid. When setting a status, it may be set to valid or invalid. 
        When a validity status is set for a link by a client, it is stored along the content hashes of the respective resource ends. 
        Content hashes represent a semantic state of a resource, factoring its all semantic properties. 
        When a link validity status is queried, the content hashes of its respective ends (subject and object) are also provided.
        The validity services looks up for a matching validity record, where the resource content hashes match those provided in the query. 
        If a matching status record is found, the stored status is returned. If no match is found, a suspect status is returned. 
        This behavior of the validity service manifests the idea that certain changes in resources may invalidate the semantics
        of the link. For example, when a test case resource validates a requirement resource, if the requirement is modified, 
        it is no longer guaranteed that the test case still validates the requirement. 
      </p>
      <p>
        A Link Validity Service relies on the domain providers to calculate the content hashes of resources, in a way that 
        factors in what properties of a resource constitute a semantic change in the resource.  
        Hence what properties of resources are considered when assessing validity, is outside the scope of the validity service.
      </p>

        <h3>Terminology</h3>
        <dl class="spaced">
          <dt><dfn>Link</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
            An assertion or RDF triple consisting of a (subject, predicate, object) that manifests an instance of a
            relationship between the referenced subject and object.
          </dd>

          <dt>LVS Client</dt>
          <dd>
            An application that consumes services provided by LVS servers to assess the validity of
            links between a particular set of source and target resources. 
          </dd>

          <dt>LVS Server</dt>
          <dd>
            A server implementing the OSLC Link Validity Service specification.
          </dd>
          <dt>Link Validity status</dt>
          <dd>
            A value associated with a link in context of its subject and object resources. The value can be valid, 
            invalid, or suspect.  
          </dd>
          <dt>Resource content hash</dt>
          <dd>
            A value associated with a resource that represents its semantic state, obtained by a hash function 
            applied on defined resource properties. Content hahes are calculated by the domain provider that owns the resource 
          </dd>
          <dt>Link Validity record</dt>
          <dd>
            An entry within the link validity services that stores a validity status of a link in respect to its subject 
            and object resource content hashes. A link is matched by its subject and object content hashes, and the URI 
            of its predicate. The Link validity record also contains also other useful attributes: 
            <ul>
              <li>The concept URIs of its subject and object resources</li>
              <li> A profile identifier to qualify validity record for a specific context</li>
              <li>The creation timestamp of the record</li>
              <li>The user id of the person that created the record</li>
              <li>A user comment for the validity update </li>

      <p>
        The following sub-sections define the mandatory and optional requirements for an OSLC Architecture Management
        (OSLC AM) server.
      </p>

      <section id="baseCompliance">
        <h2>Base Compliance</h2>
        <p class="conformance">
          This specification is based on [[!OSLCCore3]]. OSLC LVS servers MUST be compliant with both the core
          specification, MUST follow all the mandatory requirements in the normative sections of this specification, and
          SHOULD follow all the guidelines and recommendations in both these specifications.
        </p>

        <p>
          The following table summarizes the requirements from OSLC Core Specification as well as some additional
          requirements specific for LVS Servers. Note that this specification further restricts some of the requirements
          from the OSLC Core Specification. See the previous sections in this specification or the OSLC Core
          Specification to get further details on each of these requirements.

                is supported, stable paging is required. Note: as the LVS server implements a post-method as defined
                below, consider that instead of using oslc:nextPage in oslc:ResponseInfo, the use of oslc:postBody is
                required.

                is needed. Note: a scenario with multiple LVS Servers is possible, in which case multiple LVS Service
                URI are configured. This specification does not prescribe how these multiple LVS servers are managed
                together. A LVS Service SHOULD provide discovery of its link contributors via Service Provider Catalog
                which is pointing via oslc:serviceProviderCatalog to the contributing servers catalogs.

      <h2>Link Validity Service Description</h2>
      <h3>Links status inquiry</h3>
      <p>
        LVS clients inquire for links statuses related to a link predicate, subject resource hash and object resource hash, 
        typically owned and/or visualized by the client.
        It is also possible to provide the subject and object concept URIs for safeguarding the hash based matching. 
        Another optional parameter is a profile idetifier, that alows to qualify validity records for specific contexts.
        The link validity status inquiry is exposed under the get-validity-status path as described in the open-API section
        below. Link validity inquiry is a bulk operation, allowing an inquiry on multiple links. The inquiry is realized as a post request, with a body that consists of a 
        set of RDF triples for each requested link, each one contains:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Link predicate URI: A URI that identifies the link predicate
        </li>
        <li>Subject content hash: A string which is the value of the link subject resource content hash</li>
        <li>Subject concept URI (optional): The concept URI of the subject provided for safegurding the validity match </li>
        <li>Object content hash: A string which is the value of the link object resource content hash</li>
        <li> Object concept URI (optional): The concept URI of the object provided for safegurding the validity match </li>
        <li> Profile (optional): An identifier that qualifies certain validity records </li>
      </ul>

      <p> Link validity inquiry response return a set of RDF triples for each link status </p>
        <ul>
        <li>Link Predicate URI: Uri identifier of the link predicate</li>
        <li>Subject content hash</li>
        <li>Object content hash </li>
        <li>Link validity status: a string which one of "valid", "suspect", "invalid" </li>
        </ul>
        <p> in case where a matching validity record was found (status is not suspect) the following additional
          properties are returned
        </p>
        <ul>

    <h3>geting a resource hash from a provider</h3>
      <p>
        getting a resource hash is a request that needs to be supported by domain resource providers conforming to 
        link validity. Get-resource-hash is a simple get request on a concept resource uri, with a "hash" message header
