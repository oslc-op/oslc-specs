        This specification defines the OSLC SysML domain, a RESTful web services interface for the SysML v2 resources
        and relationships between those and related resources such as product change requests, activities, tasks,
        requirements or test cases. To support these scenarios, this specification defines a set of HTTP-based RESTful
        interfaces in terms of HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT and DELETE, as well as HTTP response codes, content type
        handling and resource formats.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Object Management group (<a href="https://www.omg.org">https://www.omg.org</a>) defines the OMG Systems Modeling
        Language Version 2.0 commonly referred to as SysML v2 [[!SysML]]. From OMG: "SysML is a general-purpose modeling
        language for modeling systems that is intended to facilitate a model-based systems engineering (MBSE) approach
        to engineer systems. It provides the capability to create and visualize models that represent many different
        aspects of a system.This includes representing the requirements, structure, and behavior of the system, and the
        specification of analysis cases and verification cases used to analyze and verify the system. The language is
        intended to support multiple systems engineering methods and practices. The specific methods and practices may
        impose additional constraints on how the language is used."
      </p>
      <p>
        SysML v2 plays a key role in Model-Based Systems and Software Engineering which is a major part of lifecycle
        management by defining a representation of the resources whose lifecycles are to be managed. It is therefore
        highly desirable to be able to integrate and link SysML resources with OSLC resources such as Requirements,
        Change Requests, Architecture Resources and test cases. This is accomplished by two OSLC-OP initiatives:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Contributing an OSLC PIM to PSM mapping to the OMG Systems Modeling API and Services specification
          [[SYSTEMSMODELINGAPI]] and
        </li>
        <li>
          This OASIS specification, which defines the OSLC RDF representation of SysML v2 models, and is used by
          [[SYSTEMSMODELINGAPI]].
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This specification defines the RESTful web services interface for the SysML OSLC domain that is used in the PIM
        to PSM mapping. This domain addresses the management of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) artifacts such as
        models, and relationships with other resources such as requirements, testing resources and change requests, as
        well as relationships between reusable SysML model elements in a supply chain. To support these scenarios, this
        specification defines a set of HTTP-based RESTful interfaces in terms of HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT and
        DELETE, HTTP response codes, content type handling and resource formats.
      </p>

      <p>
        The intent of this specification is to define the capabilities needed to support integration scenarios used in
        typical MBSE methods using SysML v2, and to enable linking SysML model artifacts with other OSLC lifecyle
        artifacts. This is accomplished by generating the OSLC SysML v2 vocabulary terms and constraints from the
        <a href="https://www.omg.org/spec/SysML/20230201/SysML.xmi">SysML Abstract Syntax (XMI)</a>, and having
        http://open-services.net/ns/kerml#Element subclass http://open-services.net/ns/am#Resource [[!OSLCAM]].
      </p>

      <p>
        This specification is a [[!OSLCCore3]] compliant specification, and as such most of its content are references
        to [[!OSLCCore3]].

          <dt>SysML Client</dt>
          <dd>
            An implementation of the OSLC SysML specifications as a client. OSLC SysML Clients consume services provided

            A server implementing the OSLC SysML domain specifications. OSLC SysML clients consume services provided by
            SysML Servers. The use of the terms Client and Server are intended to distinguish typical consumers and
            providers of OSLC resources in a distributed environment based on REST. A particular application component
            could be a client for some OSLC domain services and a server for the same or another domain.

      <section id="baseCompliance">
        <h2>Base Compliance</h2>
        <p class="conformance">
          This specification is based on [[!OSLCCore3]]. OSLC SysML servers MUST be compliant with both the core
          specification, MUST follow all the mandatory requirements in the normative sections of this specification, and
          SHOULD follow all the guidelines and recommendations in both these specifications.
        </p>

        <p class="conformance">
          An OSLC SysML server MUST implement the domain vocabulary defined in

        <p>
          The following table summarizes the requirements from OSLC Core Specification as well as some additional
          requirements specific to the SysML domain. Note that this specification further restricts some of the
          requirements from the OSLC Core Specification. See the previous sections in this specification or the OSLC
          Core Specification to get further details on each of these requirements.
