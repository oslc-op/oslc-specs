        This specification defines the OSLC Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) domain, a RESTful web services interface

        activities, tasks, requirements or test cases. To support these scenarios, this specification defines a set of

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        This specification defines a RESTful web services interface for the Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) domain.
        This domain addresses the management of physical and logical designs of products and parts, and relationships
        with other OSLC resources such as requirements, testing resources and change requests. To support these
        scenarios, this specification defines a set of HTTP-based RESTful interfaces in terms of HTTP methods: GET,
        POST, PUT and DELETE, HTTP response codes, content type handling and resource formats.
      </p>
      <p>
        The intent of this specification is to define the capabilities needed to support integration scenarios and not
        to provide a comprehensive interface to Product Lifecycle Management.
      </p>
      <p>
        This specification is a [[!OSLCCore3]] compliant specification, and as such most of its content are references
        to [[!OSLCCore3]].

          <dt>PLM Client</dt>
          <dd>
            An implementation of the OSLC PLM specifications as a client. OSLC PLM Clients consume services provided by
            PLM servers.
          </dd>

          <dt>PLM Server</dt>
          <dd>
            A server implementing the OSLC PLM domain specifications. OSLC PLM clients consume services provided by PLM
            Servers. The use of the terms Client and Server are intended to distinguish typical consumers and providers
            of OSLC resources in a distributed environment based on REST. A particular application component could be a
            client for some OSLC domain services and a server for the same or another domain.

        This specification defines a vocabulary for OSLC Product Lifecycle Management resources. The intent is to define

        product lifecycle management resources.

        The following is an overview of the PLM specification. The specification includes classes: Part, PartUsage,
        LogicalDesign and PhysicalDesign, and Dimension; links between these within the PLM domain and links to classes
        in other OSLC domains.

        <p class="conformance">
          This specification is based on [[!OSLCCore3]]. OSLC PLM servers MUST be compliant with both the core
          specification, MUST follow all the mandatory requirements in the normative sections of this specification, and
          SHOULD follow all the guidelines and recommendations in both these specifications.

          The following table summarizes the requirements from OSLC Core Specification as well as some additional
          requirements specific to the PLM domain. Note that this specification further restricts some of the
          requirements from the OSLC Core Specification. See the previous sections in this specification or the OSLC
          Core Specification to get further details on each of these requirements.
