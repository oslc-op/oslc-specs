		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>A common problem to building interoperable solutions is having a mechanism for a client to introspect an API or end-point
		to learn if the target application supports a set of capabilities.  Sometimes the client applications may provide limited
		or no features based on what is discovered.  An example of discovery needs includes a person using a quality management tool 
		that wants to be able to record a bug in a bug tracking tool.  The integration from the quality management tool will want to
		be able to do a number of things on behalf of the user and provide an optional integrated experience to streamline the
		users workflow.  Therefore the discovery needs include: authenticating, knowing that the target tool is capable of 
		receiving creation requests for bugs, whether it can be handled via a user interface, what fields are required and
		types of data, and also if the bug record can be pre-filled with some data from the test currently being executed.</p>
		<p></p>
	</section>

	<section id="terms">
		<h1>Terminology</h1>
		<p>Terminology is based on OSLC Core Overview [[OSLCCore3]], W3C Linked Data Platform [[LDP]], W3C's
			Architecture of the World Wide Web [[WEBARCH]],  Hyper-text
			Transfer Protocol [[HTTP11]].</p>
		<dl>
			<dt class='loc-heading'><dfn>Discovery</dfn></dt>
			<dd>The act of an OSLC Client to be able to determine if an OSLC Server supports a given capability.  It also applies
			to applications that do not operate as a client or server, for example running within a web browser.</dd>

	<section id="conformance">
	<p><em>TODO: needed for public review version of standards-track specifications, more details 
	in <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/templates/TCHandbook/ConformanceGuidelines.html#_Toc170119664">TC Handbook</a>.
	Some examples: <a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/ldpwg/raw-file/default/ldp.html#conformance">LDP</a>,

	</section>

	<section class='informative'>
		<h2>Motivation</h2>
		<p>Some key usage scenarios that motivate a number of requirements for discovery.</p>
		<p>Determine if the target tool supports:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>a certain authentication model (OAuth2, OpenID Connect, HTTP Basic)</li>
			<li>creating bug records (resources of a given kind)</li>
			<li>user interface previews</li>
			<li>user interface dialogs for creating or selecting bugs (resources of given types)</li>
			<li>prefilling dialogs</li>
			<li>describing the constraints on a bug creation or update request (shapes associated with certain operations)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Additionally there is motivation to establish a common way for tools to support similar mechanisms so
		that each new capability doesn't introduce a new discovery model.  It is also desired to have capabilities defined, whether
		within a standards development group or proprietary, to be able to leverage a similar approach to discovery.</p>
		<p>The basis for how clients discovery capability should be based on the methods established by [[LDP]] and [[HTTP11]].</p>

		<h2>Basic Concepts</h2>
		<p>TODO: determine if needed</p>
	</section>   -->

	<section>
		<h2>Discovery Approaches</h2>
		<p>There are various approaches for both specifications to define how their capabilities
		could be advertised and how clients can efficiently discover what is needed.  The follow sections
		will provide guidance on approaches that should be used.</p>
		
		<section id="differentApproaches">
			<h2>Choosing most effective methods</h2>
			
			<section id="discOptions"><h2 class="normal">
				Clients SHOULD use <code>HTTP OPTIONS</code> to fetch various headers and other configurations
				information that MAY BE exposed in the response content body.
			</h2></section>
			
			<section id="discHeaders"><h2 class="normal">
				Servers SHOULD minimize the use of HTTP response headers on various HTTP operations as to not provide
				unnecessary additional response content and complexity on server implementations to provide it.
			</h2></section>

			<section id="discContent"><h2 class="normal">
				Servers SHOULD only use LDPR representations for discovery details.  It is also useful for scenarios where
				it would be valuable to have the discovery data readily available for purposes such as query.
			</h2></section>
		</section>
		
		<section id="creation">
			<h2>Checking for creation of a certain type of resource</h2>
			
			<section id="doesCreate"><h2 class="normal">
				The existence of an <code>Accept-Post</code> header on an HTTP response to a given Request-URI will
				indicate that both an HTTP POST is accepted for authorized requests and which content types are support
				in the entity body of an HTTP POST request. Restating of [[LDP]] <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/#header-accept-post">
				conformance clause about <code>Accept-Post</code></a>.
			</h2></section>
			
			<section id="isLDPC"><h2 class="normal">
				The existence of a <code>Link: &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Container&gt;; rel="type"</code> header on 
				an HTTP response to a given Request-URI will indicate that the resource is a LDP Container. Restating
				conformance clause for [[LDP]]
				<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/#ldpc-linktypehdr"><code>Link</code> header and resource types</a>.
			</h2></section>

			<section id="createsTypes"><h2 class="normal">
				Servers SHOULD include the target URI of a <code>Link: &lt;type-URI&gt;; rel="http://open-services.net/ns/core#creationType"</code> 
				header on an HTTP response to a given Request-URI to indicate the type-URI (i.e.<code>rdf:type</code>) for the type of resources
				that can be created by the LDP Container. Note: since there is always some time between when the
				test is done and when the creation request is sent, and that there may be additional server enforced constraints
				on the creation resource representation, there is no guarantee that a future creation request will succeed.</h2>
				<pre class='example'>
				Link: &lt;http://open-services.net/ns/cm#Bug&gt;; rel="http://open-services.net/ns/core#creationType",
				      &lt;http://example.com/vocab#Feature&gt;; rel="http://open-services.net/ns/core#creationType"
				</pre>			
			</section>
			
			<section id="createTypesPred"><h2 class="normal">
				Servers MAY include a RDF triple in resource response body of the form: <code>&lt;container-URI&gt; oslc:creationType &lt;type-URI&gt;</code>.</h2>
				Clients SHOULD use the predicate <code>oslc:creationType</code> when converting HTTP response headers for the same Link-relation type, into
				an RDF triple.	This is to assist with scenarios where client applications may want to use the RDF representation in a query
				to locate LDP Containers that can be used to create the same resource types.
			</section>
						
			<section id="isCreateEx" class='informative'><h2 class='normal'>Example</h2>
				<p>Complete example highlighting that POST is supported, which content types are supported on POST, 
				the fact that the resource is a LDP Container and it advertises support for creating two types of
				resources.  Here showing the request (OPTIONS) and then the response:</p>
				<pre class='example'>
				OPTIONS /bugs/ HTTP/1.1
				Host: example.come

				      &lt;http://example.com/vocab#Feature&gt;; rel="http://open-services.net/ns/core#creationType"
				</pre>
			</section>
		</section>
		
		<section id="creationShapes"><h2>Checking for constraints for creation</h2>
		    <p>In addition to the ways one can discover if a given OSLC Server supports creation of resources
		    and for which types, it is helpful to understand if there are server-enforced constraints on
		    the resource representation.</p>
		    
			<section id="createsWithShapes"><h2 class="normal">
				Servers SHOULD include the target URI of a <code>Link: &lt;<em>constraints-URI</em>&gt;; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#constrainedBy"</code>
				header on an HTTP response to a given Request-URI to indicate the <code><em>constraint-URI</em></code> 
				of a resource that defines the constraints about the to-be created resource representation against a LDP Container.
				The resource defined by <code><em>constraint-URI</em></code> is RECOMMENDED to be a machine-readible representation
				such as OSLC Resource Shape but MAY be some variant or other constraint document [[OSLCShapes2]].			
				See [[LDP]]	<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/#ldpr-gen-pubclireqs">section about server published constraints</a>.

			<section id="createWithShapesPred"><h2 class="normal">
				Servers MAY include a RDF triple in resource response body of the form:	<code>&lt;container-URI&gt; ldp:constrainedBy &lt;shape-URI&gt;</code>.</h2>
				Clients SHOULD use the predicate <code>ldp:constrainedBy</code> when converting HTTP response headers for the same Link-relation type, into
				an RDF triple.	This is to assist with scenarios where client applications may want to use the RDF representation in a query
