<p>This specification defines the OSLC Change Management domain, a RESTful web
services interface for the management of product change requests, activities,
tasks and relationships between those and related resources such as requirements, test cases, or architectural resources. To support these scenarios, this specification
defines a set of HTTP-based RESTful interfaces in terms of HTTP methods: GET,

<section id="introduction" class="informative">
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This specification defines the OSLC Change management domain as a RESTful web
services interface for the management of product change requests, activities,
tasks and relationships between those and related resources such as project,
category, release and plan. To support these scenarios, this specification
defines a set of HTTP-based RESTful interfaces in terms of HTTP methods: GET,
POST, PUT and DELETE, HTTP response codes, content type handling and resource
formats.</p>

<p>The intent of this specification is to define the capabilities needed to
support integration scenarios defined by the OASIS OSLC Open Project
and not to provide a comprehensive interface to Change Management. The resource
formats and operations may not match exactly the native models supported by
change management servers but are intended to be compatible with
them. The approach to supporting these scenarios is to delegate operations, as
driven by server contributed user interfaces, as much as possible and
not require a server to expose its complete data model and
application logic.</p>

<section id="terminology">

<h2>Terminology</h2>
  <p>Terminology uses and extends the terminology and capabilities of [[!OSLCCore3]].</p>

  <dl class="glossary">
    <dt>Change Request Resource</dt>
    <dd>A request for change to an
        application or product. Typically a product request for enhancement, a report for a resolution of a product defect or simply a bug report.</dd>

    <dt>Client</dt>
    <dd>An implementation of the OSLC Change Management specifications as a client. OSLC CM Clients consume services provided by servers.</dd>

    <dt>Server</dt>
    <dd>An implementation of the OSLC Change Management specifications as a server. OSLC CM clients consume services provided by Servers. The use of the terms Client and Server are intended to distinguish typical consumers and providers of OSLC resources in a distributed environment based on REST. A particular application component could be a client for some OSLC domain services and a server for the same or another domain.</dd>

<section id="versioning">
<h2 id="specificationversioningspec_versioning">Specification Versioning</h2>

<p>This specification follows the specification version guidelines given in [OSLCCore3].</p>
</section>

<section id="namespaces">
<h2>Namespaces</h2>

<p>In addition to the namespace URIs and namespace prefixes <code>oslc</code>, <code>rdf</code>, <code>dcterms</code> and <code>foaf</code> defined in the [OSLCCore3], OSLC CM defines the namespace URI of <code>http://open-services.net/ns/cm#</code> with a namespace prefix of <code>oslc_cm</code>.</p>

<p>This specification also uses these namespace prefix definitions:</p>

<ul>
<li>oslc_rm : <code>http://open-services.net/ns/rm#</code> [[OSLCRM]]</li>
<li>oslc_qm : <code>http://open-services.net/ns/qm#</code> [[OSLCQM]]</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="formats">
<h2>Resource Formats</h2>

<p>In addition to the requirements for resource representations in [[!OSLCCore3]], this section outlines further refinements and restrictions.</p>

<p>For HTTP GET requests on all OSLC CM and OSLC Core defined resource types,</p>

<ul>
<li class='conformance'>CM servers MUST provide Turtle and JSON-LD, and SHOULD provide RDF/XML and XML representations. The XML and JSON representations SHOULD follow the guidelines outlined in the <a href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OSLCCoreSpecAppendixRepresentations">OSLC Core Representations Guidance</a> to maintain compatibility with [[!OSLCCore2]].</li>
<li class='conformance'>CM clients requesting RDF/XML SHOULD be prepared for any valid RDF/XML document. CM clients requesting XML SHOULD be prepared for representations that follow the guidelines outlined in the <a href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OSLCCoreSpecAppendixRepresentations">OSLC Core Representations Guidance</a>.</li>
<li class='conformance'>CM servers SHOULD support an [X]HTML representation and a user interface (UI) preview as defined by <a href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OslcCoreUiPreview">UI Preview Guidance</a></li>
</ul>

<p>For HTTP PUT/POST request formats for resource type of ChangeRequest:</p>

<ul>
<li class='conformance'>CM servers MUST accept Turtle and JSON-LD representations and SHOULD accept RDF/XML and XML representations. CM servers accepting RDF/XML SHOULD be prepared for any valid RDF/XML document. For XML CM servers SHOULD be prepared for representations that follow the guidelines outlined in the <a href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OSLCCoreSpecAppendixRepresentations">OSLC Core Representations Guidance</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>For HTTP GET response formats for Query requests,</p>

<p class='conformance'>CM servers MUST provide Turtle and JSON-LD, SHOULD provide RDF/XML, XML, and MAY provide Atom Syndication Format XML representations.</p>

<div  class='conformance'>
<p>When CM clients request:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>text/turtle</code> CM servers MUST respond with Turtle representation.</li>
<li><code>application/ld+json</code> CM servers MUST respond with JSON-LD representation.</li>
<li><code>application/rdf+xml</code> CM servers SHOULD respond with RDF/XML representation without restrictions.</li>
<li><code>application/xml</code> CM servers SHOULD respond with OSLC-defined abbreviated XML representation as defined in the <a href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OSLCCoreSpecAppendixRepresentations">OSLC Core Representations Guidance</a></li>
<li><code>application/atom+xml</code> CM servers SHOULD respond with Atom Syndication Format XML representation as defined in the <a href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OSLCCoreSpecAppendixRepresentations">OSLC Core Representations Guidance</a></li>
<li>The Atom Syndication Format XML representation SHOULD use RDF/XML representation without restrictions for the atom:content entries representing the resource representations.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>See Query Capabilities for additional information when Resource Shapes affect representation.</p>

<section id="contentNegotiation">
<h2>Content Negotiation</h2>

<p>[[!OSLCCore3]] specifies RDF representations (and specifically Turtle and JSON-LD) as a convention that all OSLC server implementations minimally provide and accept. OSLC CM server implementations are strongly encouraged to adopt this convention. Future versions of this specification are expected to require RDF representations for all operations and relax requirements for specialized XML representations.</p>

<p><strong>XML Representation</strong> - identified by the <code>application/xml</code> content type. Format representation rules are outlined in Core <a href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OSLCCoreSpecAppendixRepresentations">OSLC Core Resource Formats section</a></p>

<p><strong>RDF/XML Representation</strong> - identified by the <code>application/rdf+xml</code> content type. No additional guidance is given.</p>

<p><strong>JSON-LD Representation</strong> - identified by the <code>application/ld+json</code> content type. Format representation rules are specified in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/">JSON-LD 1.0</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Atom Syndication Format XML Representation</strong> - identified by the <code>application/atom+xml</code> content type. Format representation rules are outlined in Core <a href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OSLCCoreSpecAppendixRepresentations">OSLC Core Resource Formats section</a>.</p>
</section>
</section>

<section id="authentication">
<h2>Authentication</h2>

<p class='conformance'>[[!OSLCCore3]] specifies the recommended OSLC authentication mechanisms. In addition to the OSLC Core authentication requirements, OSLC CM servers SHOULD support [[!OpenIDConnect]].</p>
</section>

<section id="errors">
<h2>Error Responses</h2>

<p>[[!OSLCCoreVocab]] specifies the OSLC Core error responses. OSLC CM puts no additional constraints on error responses.</p>
</section>

<section id="pagination">
<h2>Pagination</h2>

<p class='conformance'>OSLC CM servers SHOULD support pagination of query results and MAY support pagination of a single resource's properties as defined by [[!OSLCCore3]].</p>
</section>

<section id="requestProps">
<h3>Requesting and Updating Properties</h3>

<section id="requestSubset">
<h4>Requesting a Subset of Properties</h4>

<p class='conformance'>A client MAY request a subset of a resource's properties as well as properties from a referenced resource. In order to support this behavior a server MUST support the <code>oslc.properties</code> and <code>oslc.prefix</code> URL parameter on a HTTP GET request on individual resource request or a collection of resources by query. If the <code>oslc.properties</code> parameter is omitted on the request, then all resource properties MUST be provided in the response.</p>
</section>

<section id="updateSubset">
<h4>Updating a Subset of Properties</h4>

<p class='conformance'>A client MAY request that a subset of a resource's properties be updated by using the [[LDPPatch]] <code>PATCH</code> method.</p>

<p class='conformance'>For compatibility with [[!OSLCCore2]], CM servers  class='conformance' also support partial update by identifying those properties to be modified using the <code>oslc.properties</code> URL parameter on a HTTP PUT request.</p>

<p class='conformance'>If the parameter <code>oslc.properties</code> contains a valid resource property on the request that is not provided in the content, the server MUST set the resource's property to a null or empty value. If the parameter <code>oslc.properties</code> contains an invalid resource property, then a <code>409 Conflict</code> MUST be returned.</p>
</section>

<section id="updatingMultiValueProps">
<h4>Updating Multi-Valued Properties</h4>

<p class='conformance'>For multi-valued properties that contain a large number of values, it may be difficult and inefficient to add or remove property values. OSLC CM servers MAY provide support for a partial update of the multi-valued properties as defined by draft specification [[LDPPatch]]. CM servers MAY also support partial updates through HTTP PUT where only the updated properties are included in the entity request body.</p>
</section>
</section>

<section id="statePredicates">
<h3>Status, State and State Predicates</h3>
<p>Probably the most important property of a Change Request is the status property. "Status" specifies the location of a Change Request in a workflow. The <code>oslc_cm:status</code> property is a typically read-only string that servers can set to describe the status of a ChangeRequest. In queries the oslc_cm:status property can be used to filter change request (e.g. all change requests that are "fixed") and may be used to perform state transitions (not part of this specification) on a change request, e.g. closing a change request as "fixed".</p>

<p>The problem is that different CM servers may use different properties (or even a set of properties) and different values to represent the change request's state. Even providing access to meta data does not help because knowing all possible state values does not reveal the semantics of a state.</p>

<p>[[OSLCCM20]] introduced State Predicates to define single-value often read-only Boolean properties on a Change Request resource that allow servers to translate their specific status string values into a standard boolean state predicate value. For example, a CM server could set <code>oslc_cm:status</code> to "BeingInvestigated", and map this status to the following state predicate values:</p>
<ul>
  <li>oslc_cm:closed=false</li>
  <li>oslc_cm:inProgress=true</li>
  <li>oslc_cm:fixed=false</li>
  <li>oslc_cm:approved=false</li>
  <li>oslc_cm:reviewed=false</li>
  <li>oslc_cm:verified=false</li>
</ul>

<p class='conformance'>An attempt to update read-only predicates SHOULD be answered with a 409 Conflict HTTP status code. Their presence in a resource representation used for an update via PUT MUST NOT prevent the resource from being updated. Predicates MUST be queryable. The Change Request resource definition sections defines the complete set of predicates.</p>

<p class='conformance'>OSLC CM 3.0 provides a similar means of defining a set of standard states that is also extensible. The <code>oslc_cm:state</code> property can have a value of type <code>oslc_cm:State</code> which represents an enumeration of individuals representing a standard set of ChangeRequest states. Servers MAY define additional individuals to extend the states of different ChangeRequest types and lifecycles.</p>
</section>

<section id="labels" class='informative'>
<h3>Labels for Relationships</h3>

<p>Change Management relationships to other resources are represented by RDF properties. Instances of a relationship - often called links - are RDF triples with a subject URI, a predicate that is the property, and a value (or object) that is the URI of target resource. When a link is to be presented in a user interface, it may be helpful to display an informative and useful textual label instead of or in addition to the URI of the predicate and or object. There are three items that clients could display:
<ul>
  <li><b>The property</b>: OSLC recommends using the rdfs:label property of the rdf:Property from the vocabulary to display the property.</li>
  <li><b>The value, or object of the triple</b>: OSLC recommends using OSLC resource preview [[!OSLCResourcePreview]] to obtain an appropriate icon and label, and possibly a small and/or large dialog for displaying the object.</li>
  <li><b>The link</b>: The link is a combination of the subject, predicate and object of the triple (RDF statement or assertion). In the case where the link requires a unique label that is not available from the target resource, only then OSLC servers may support a dcterms:title on a reified statement to provide a label for a link that describes the assertion itself.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Turtle example using a reified statement:</p>

<h2>CM Server Capabilities</h2>

<section id="resources">
<h3>Server Resources</h3>

<p class='conformance'>OSLC CM servers MUST support OSLC Discovery capabilities defined by [[!OSLCCore3]].</p>

<p class='conformance'>OSLC CM servers MAY provide a ServiceProvider Resource that can be retrieved at a implementation dependent URI.</p>

<p class='conformance'>OSLC CM servers MAY provide a ServiceProviderCatalog Resource that can be retrieved at a implementation dependent URI.</p>

<p class='conformance'>OSLC CM servers MAY provide a <code>oslc:serviceProvider</code> property for their defined resources that will be the URI to a ServiceProvider Resource.</p>

<p class='conformance'>OSLC CM servers MUST supply a value of <code>http://open-services.net/ns/cm#</code> for the property <code>oslc:domain</code> on either <code>oslc:Service</code> or <code>oslc:ServiceProviderCatalog</code> resources.</p>
</section>

<p class='conformance'>OSLC CM servers MAY allow ChangeRequest state change through [[OSLCActions]].</p>

<section id="creationfactories">
<h3>Creation Factories</h3>

<p class='conformance'>OSLC CM servers MUST support <a href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OslcCoreSpecification#Creation_Factories">Creation Factories</a> and list them in the Service Provider Resource as defined by OSLC Core. OSLC CM servers SHOULD support Resource Shapes for Creation Factories as defined in [[!OSLCShapes]]</p>
</section>

<section id="querycapabilities">
<h3 id="querycapabilities">Query Capabilities</h3>

<p class='conformance'>OSLC CM servers SHOULD support the <a href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OslcCoreSpecification#Query_Capabilities">Query Capabilities</a> as defined by [[!OSLCCore3]]. OSLC CM servers SHOULD support Resource Shapes for Query Capability as defined in [[!OSLCShapes]]</p>

<div  class='conformance'>
<p>The Query Capability, if supported, MUST support these parameters:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>oslc.where</code></li>
<li><code>oslc.select</code></li>
<li><code>oslc.properties</code></li>
<li><code>oslc.prefix</code></li>
</ul>
</div>

<div  class='conformance'>
<p>If shape information is NOT present with the Query Capability, servers SHOULD use these default properties to contain the result:
<ul>
  <li>For RDF/XML and XML, use <code>rdf:Description</code> and <code>rdfs:member</code> as defined in <a href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OSLCCoreSpecAppendixRepresentations#Specifying_the_shape_of_a_query">OSLC Core RDF/XML Examples</a>.</li>
  <li>For JSON, the query results are contained within <code>oslc:results</code> array. See <a href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OSLCCoreSpecAppendixRepresentations#Guidelines_for_JSON">OSLC Core Representation Guidance for JSON</a></li></ul></p>
</section>
</div>

<section id="delegatedUIs">
<h3>Delegated UIs</h3>

<p class='conformance'>OSLC CM servers MUST support the selection and creation of resources by delegated web-based user interface dialogs <a href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OslcCoreSpecification#Delegated_User_Interface_Dialogs">Delegated UIs</a> as defined by [[!OSLCCore3]].</p>

<p class='conformance'>OSLC CM servers MAY support the pre-filling of creation dialogs based on the definition at <a href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OslcCoreSpecification#Delegated_User_Interface_Dialogs">Delegated UIs</a>.</p>
</section>

<section id="usageidentifiers">
<h3>Usage Identifiers</h3>

<p>An OSLC CM server can identify or distinguish the usage of various services with additional property values for the <a href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OslcCoreSpecification#Service_Provider_Resources">OSLC Core</a> defined <code>oslc:usage</code> property on <code>oslc:Dialog</code>, <code>CreationFactory</code> and <code>QueryCapability</code>. The <code>oslc:usage</code> property value of <code>http://open-services.net/ns/core#default</code> will be used to designate the default or primary service to be used by clients when multiple entries are found.</p>

<p>The additional Change Management property values for <code>oslc:usage</code> are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>http://open-services.net/ns/cm#defect</code> - primarily used by QM tools to report defects in testing.</li>
<li><code>http://open-services.net/ns/cm#planItem</code> - used by QM and PPM tools for associating change requests into plans (project, release, sprint, etc).</li>
<li><code>http://open-services.net/ns/cm#task</code> - used by QM and PPM tools for associating change requests into executable and track-able items.</li>
<li><code>http://open-services.net/ns/cm#requirementsChangeRequest</code> - used by RM tools for associating a change request for usage in tracking changes to a Requirements resource</li>
</ul>
