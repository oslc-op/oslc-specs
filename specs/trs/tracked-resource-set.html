  <p> The Tracked Resource Set protocol allows a server to expose a set of resources in a way that allows clients to discover the exact set of resources
    in the set, to track additions to and removals from the set, and to track state changes to the resources in the set.
    The protocol does not assume that clients will dereference the resources, but they may.
    The protocol is suitable for dealing with large sets containing a large number of resources,
    as well as highly active resource sets that undergo continual change.
    The protocol is HTTP-based and follows RESTful principles. </p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p> An OSLC Tracked Resource Set (TRS) provides a mechanism for making a set of resources discoverable and for reporting ongoing changes affecting the set.
    This allows tools to expose a live feed of linked lifecycle data in a way that permits other tools to build, aggregate, and maintain live,
    searchable information based on that linked data. </p>
  <p> TRS Clients can use Tracked Resource Sets to monitor or replicate some of the server’s resources, keeping up to date with changes.
    A single TRS Client could get information from many different TRS Servers and Tracked Resource Sets in order to aggregate information
    into a repository for more efficient federated access to the resource data, or for access using a different query language or protocol.
    The TRS protocol does not guarantee that a client can calculate a complete change history (audit log) for the tracked resources.</p>

<section id='concepts' class='informative'>
  <h2>Basic Concepts</h2>
  <p> A TRS Server maintains one or more Tracked Resource Sets.
    The TRS Server decides which particular resources are in a particular Tracked Resource Set at any moment;
    both the Tracked Resource Sets and the linked data contents of each Tracked Resource may vary over time.
    An HTTP GET request sent to the Tracked Resource Set URI returns a representation of the state of the Tracked Resource Set characterized in terms of a Base and a Change Log.
    The Base is a Linked Data Platform (LDP) Container providing a point-in-time enumeration of the Tracked Resource members of the Tracked Resource Set;
    The Change Log provides a (possibly empty) time-ordered series of adjustments describing changes to the Tracked Resources.
    When the Base is empty, the Change Log describes a history of how the Tracked Resource Set has grown and evolved since its inception.
    A TRS Server may periodically update the Base of a TRS and truncate the Change Log to avoid excessively large Change Logs.
    Clients may read the Base and poll the Change Log to derive and maintain an up to date picture of the state of all the Tracked Resources in a Tracked Resource Set.</p>
  <p> The Change Log portion may contain earlier Change Event entries that would be accounted for by the Base portion.
    A “cutoff” property of the Base identifies the point in the Change Log at which processing of Change Events can be cut off
    because older changes are already covered by the Base portion.
    TRS Clients use the Base to establish the resources to track, and the Change Log to address changes to those resources.
    TRS Clients are responsible for knowing what change events they have already processed in the Change Log,
    and should only process new change events. </p>
</section>
<section id='discovery'>
  <h2>Discovery</h2>
  <p class='note' title='Discovery is a convenience'> Discoverability is a convenience;
    an administrator can configure a Client with a particular Tracked Resource Set
    knowing just the URIs of the Server's Tracked Resource Set and designated
    Access Context List resource. An administrator can retrieve the Access
    Context List resource to discover the titles and URIs of the Access Contexts
    being used with that Server.
    Documentation for an TRS Server can describe its Tracked Resource Sets,
    including the URI of each of the Server's Tracked Resource Set resources and
    designated Access Context List resources. </p>
  <p> A Server MAY provide multiple Tracked Resource Sets,
    and MAY make its Tracked Resource Sets discoverable. </p>
  <p> The RDF <code>trs:trackedResourceSet</code> property can be used to
    declare the whereabouts of a Tracked Resource Set resource. The Tracked
    Resource Set resource is the object. </p>
  <p> This allows the existence and location of a Tracked Resource Set
    resource to be declared with an RDF statement like the following (rendered
    here in Turtle): </p>
  <pre class='example'>
@prefix trs: &lt;http://open-services.net/ns/core/trs#&gt; .
&lt;&gt; trs:trackedResourceSet &lt;https://a.example.com/trs1&gt; .
    </pre>
  <p> The RDF <code>oslc_acc:accessContextList</code> property declares the
    whereabouts of an Access Context List resource. The Access Context List
    resource is the object. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Property Name: accessContextList</li>
    <li>Description: URI of Access Context List resource</li>
    <li>Property URI: <code>http://open-services.net/ns/core/acc#accessContextList</code></li>
  </ul>
  <p> This allows the existence and location of an Access Context List resource
    to be declared with an RDF statement like the following (rendered here in
    Turtle): </p>
  <pre class='example'>
@prefix oslc_acc: &lt;http://open-services.net/ns/core/acc#&gt; .
&lt;&gt; oslc_acc:accessContextList &lt;https://a.example.com/acclist&gt; .
    </pre>
  <p> Where such RDF statements might be found is outside the scope of this specification.</p>

<section id='general-behavior'>
  <h2>General Behavior></h2>
  <p> Tracked Resources MUST have a RDF linked data representation,
    and SHOULD support GET requests conformant with [[OSLCCore2]] or [[OSLCCore3]]. </p>
  <p>The TRS Server SHOULD support ETags, caching, and conditional GETs for Tracked Resources;
      <span class='red'>TBD: TRS Servers MAY support ETags, caching, and conditional GETs for Tracked Resource Sets and Base resources</span>.</p>
  <p>TRS servers MUST support Turtle (<code>text/turtle</code>) representations of the TRS, Base, Change Log and Change Event resources,
    and MAY support other representations, using standard HTTP content negotiation.
    If the client does not indicate a preference, <code>text/turtle</code> MUST be returned.</p>
</section>
<section id='change-logs'>
  <h2>Change Logs and Change Events</h2>
  <p>A Server MUST refer to a given Tracked Resource using the exact same URI in the Base membership property
    and every Change Event (<code>trs:changed</code> reference) for that resource.</p>
  <p>A Change Log represents a series of changes to the corresponding Tracked Resource Set over some period of time.
    The Change Log MUST contain a sufficient sequence of Change Events such that processing the Base and the Change Log
    gives a consistent and complete picture of the Tracked Resources at at the end of that period of time;
    the Change Log does not necessarily identify <em>every</em> change of internal state before or during that period of time.</p>
  <p>A Server MAY batch up internal changes and add Change Events to the Change Log in a single transaction at some interval.</p>
  <p>A Server MUST eventually report a resource modification event if a GET on that resource would return a semantically different response from previously.</p>
  <p>A Server MAY report a modification event even in cases where there would be no significant difference in response.</p>
  <p>When a resource is modified two or more times in rapid succession,
    a Server MAY elide such modifications by reporting only a single modification event in the Change Log.</p>
  <p>When a resource is created and deleted in rapid succession, a Server MAY omit all Change Events for that resource.</p>
  <p>Because of the highly dynamic nature of the Resource Set and the difficulty of enumerating an exact set of resources at a precise point in time,
    a Server MAY produce a Base that is only an approximation of the Tracked Resource Set membership.
    A Base might omit mention of a Resource that ought to have been included or include a Resource that ought to have been omitted.
    For each such inconsistency in the Base, the Server MUST at some point include a corrective Change Event in the Change Log more recent that the base cutoff event.
    The corrective Change Event corrects the picture for that Resource, allowing a client to compute the correct set of Tracked Resources.</p>
  <p class='note'> A corrective Change Event might not appear in the Change Log that was retrieved when the client dereferenced the Tracked Resource Set URI;
    the client might only see a corrective Change Event when it processes the Change Log resource obtained by dereferencing the Tracked Resource Set URI on later occasions.</p>
  <p>Similarly, a TRS Server MAY report unnecessary Change Events such as a creation event for a Resource that is already a member of the Resource Set,
    or a deletion or modification event for a Resource that is not a member of the Resource Set.</p>
  <p class='note'>Clients should ignore these redundant events.</p>
</section>
<section id='change-log-segments'>
  <h2>Change Log Segmentation</h2>
  <p>Often, the number of Change Events in the Change Log will grow to the point where
    it is not reasonable to contain all the Change Events in a single HTTP response.
    In this case, the most recent Change Events MUST be included in the Tracked Resource Set itself,
      and earlier events MAY be segmented into separate Change Log resources referenced from the <code>trs:previous</code> property.
      There can be any number of such Change Log segments, each one containing earlier and earlier events.</p>
  <p>Just as the most recent Change Events MUST be included in the HTTP response for the Change Log in the Tracked Resource Set resource itself,
    TRS Servers MUST include the Change Events for each Change Log segment in the HTTP response for the Change Log segment.</p>
  <p class='note'>This allows a Client to  discover the most recent Change Events, and retrieve successively older Change Log resources
      until it encounters a Change Event that has already been processed (on a previous check).
      The protocol does not attach significance to where a Server breaks the Change Log into separate parts,
      i.e., the number of entries in a trs:ChangeLog is entirely up to the Server.</p>
</section>
<section id='paged-base'>
  <h2>Paged Base</h2>
  <p>Often, the number of member Resources in the Base will grow to the point where it is not reasonable to contain all the Resources in a single HTTP response. 
  In this case, the base member Resources may be segmented into separate resources. There can be any number of such base member Resource segments, each one containing a subset of all  base member Resource segments</p>

</section>
<section id='rebase'>
  <h2>Truncating Change Logs, and Rebasing</h2>
  <p>A chain of Change Logs MAY continue all the way back to the inception of the Tracked Resource Set and contain Change Events for every change made since then.
    However, to avoid maintaining this ever growing list of Change Logs indefinitely,
    a Server MAY truncate the Change Log at a suitable point in the chain.
    This can be accomplished by deleting the oldest segments of the Change Log
      and/or by removing <code>trs:previous</code> links that reference them,
      and/or by removing obsolete Change Events from the end of the Change Log.</p>
  <p class='note'>TRS Servers may therefore return HTTP status code 404 (Not found) when navigating the "previous" reference from a final or stale Change Log segment;
      clients should interpret this as indicating that they have reached the end of the change log.</p>
  <p>To ensure that a new Client can always get started, the Change Log MUST contain the base cutoff event of the corresponding Base, and all Change Events more recent than it.
      Thus the Server is only allowed to truncate Change Events older than the base cutoff event.
      When the Base has no base cutoff event
      (i.e., the Base enumerates the Resource Set at the start of time),
      the Change Log MUST contain all Change Events back to the start of time; i.e., no truncation is allowed.</p>
  <p class='note'>While servers must preserve the cutoff event in the truncated change log, the same is not true of any earlier events that a client might have already processed.
      For this reason, a client should not assume that it will find a change event that it has previously processed: that change event might have been truncated.</p>
  <p>To allow truncation of long Change Logs, a TRS Server MAY calculate a new base set at any time, with a new cutoff event in the Change Log.
      When doing this, TRS Servers SHOULD take care to handle clients that are currently processing the older Base and Change Log:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>When calculating a new Base, the TRS Server SHOULD retain a minimum of seven days worth of Change Events before the new cutoff event.</li>
    <li class='red'>TBD: <em>If paging of the base is supported (see other TBD section),
        then the server should take care to avoid mismatching pairing of a new change log with the old base and vice versa.</em></li>

       For a Resource that changes frequently, a typical Client may retrieve the
       same Resource over and over again. When the representation
       of the Resource is large and the differences between adjacent representations can
       be described compactly, including additional information in the
       trs:Modification Change Event can allow the Client to determine the
       Resource’s current representation and thereby avoid having to retrieve the
       Resource.
     </p>
     <p>
       Similiarly, in versioned worlds each change to a versioned resource may
       result in the creation of a new Resource representing an immutable version of
       the resource. The typical Client retrieves each such Resource as it is created. The
       state of the new Resource is often quite similar to the state of a
       Resource corresponding to a previous version. When the state of one
       Resource is similar to that of another Resource and the differences
       between the two can be described compactly, including additional information
       in the trs:Creation Change Event can allow the Client to determine the new
       Resource’s resultant state from the potentially-known state of a
       previously-retrieved  Resource and thereby avoid having to retrieve the
       new Resource.

       <h2>LD Patch</h2>
       <p class="ednote" title="TBD">
         <strong>Editor: the LD Patch spec has moved up to working group note 28 july
         2015. (img)</strong>
       </p>
       <p class="ednote" title="TBD">
         <strong>Editor: the meaning of "temporarily" below is not clear. (img)</strong>
       </p>
       <p>
         The Linked Data Patch (LD Patch) specification is currently under
         development by the W3C LDP WG. Our intention is to adopt the syntax and
         semantics of LD patches from the LD Patch specification rather than
         specifying our own. However, the LD Patch effort is only just beginning,
         and the First Public Working Draft was published on 18 September 2014.
       </p>
       <p>
         In an effort to insulate Servers from changes to the LD Patch
         specification while it is being refined, this document proposes that
         Servers temporarily limit themselves to generating LD patches in a
         limited subset which we call Core format. Core format is extremely simple
         (no prefixes, no variables, and no Binds) but perfectly adequate for
         describing patches to graphs not involving blank nodes. (Core format is
         based on an early (and unofficial) precursor called RDF Patch.)
       </p>
       <p>
         A Core format patch consists of a sequence of rows. A row with ‘A’ (or
         ‘D’) in the first column describes the addition (deletion) of one RDF
         triple from the resource’s RDF data graph. The subject, predicate, and
         object of the triples are described in columns 2-4 in the form of absolute
         URI references enclosed between ‘&lt;’ and ‘&gt;’. Each row is delimited by a
         ‘.’ and may have white space between the various terms in a row, including
         newlines.
       </p>
       <p>
         Example of a Core format patch that deletes one RDF triple (subject <code>http://example.com/bob</code>,
         predicate <code>http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows</code>, object <code>https://example.com/alice</code>)
         and adds another an RDF triple (subject <code>https://example.com/fred</code>, predicate <code>http://http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/member</code>,
         object <code>http://example.com/old-timers</code>):

  <h2>Access Context</h2>
  <p class='note' title='TO DO'> This entire section has not yet been edited for brevity and to remove duplication. </p>
  <p> A Client that provides services based on resources fetched from a Tracked
    Resource Set Server, may want to control access to those Resources.  It is
    simple enough for a Client to allow some users to
    access these copies, while denying access to other users. </p>
  <p> In order to make it feasible for Clients to offer access control that
    reflects the access control on the Tracked Resource Set Server, a Server can
    define one or more Access Contexts and associate each of its Resources with an
    Access Context. When configuring a Client to work with a particular Server,
    the administrator can query the Server for a list of relevant Access
    Contexts. This allows the administrator to configure access control at the
    level of Access Contexts within a Tracked Resource Set. </p>
  <p> For its part, the Server associates each of its Resources with an Access
    Context, asserted in the representation of each Resource. This lets the Client
    connect access control rules expressed in terms of Access Contexts with the
    resource representations copied from the Server. Adding a resource to an
    Access Context, or removing one from it, changes the RDF representation of the
    resource. Like other changes affecting the RDF representation of the resource,
    this change is reported as a Change Event in the Server's Tracked Resource
    Set. This supports Clients working with Servers whose resources' Access
    Contexts vary over time. </p>
  <p class='note' title='TBD'> <strong>Editor: related to https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/OSLCCORE-82. (img)</strong> </p>
  <p> This set of Access Contexts within a Server can also change over time. Adding
    a new Access Context Client will generally require an administrator to reconfigure
    the Client against that Server. </p>
  <section id='accAssociations'>
    <h2>Associations between Resources and Access Contexts</h2>
    <p> The RDF <code>oslc_acc:accessContext</code> property is used to indicate that a resource
      belongs to an Access Context. The resource is the subject; the Access Context
      is the object. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Property Name: accessContext</li>
      <li>Description: Access Context of the resource</li>
      <li>Property URI: http://open-services.net/ns/core/acc#accessContext</li>
    </ul>
    <p> For example, the RDF statement (in Turtle): </p>
    <pre class='example'>
@prefix oslc_acc: &lt;http://open-services.net/ns/core/acc#&gt; .
&lt;https://a.example.com/defect/2314&gt; oslc_acc:accessContext &lt;https://a.example.com/acclist#alpha&gt; .
  </pre>
    <p> declares the resource <code>https://a.example.com/defect/2314</code> to be in the Access Context <code>https://a.example.com/acclist#alpha</code>. </p>
    <section id='accessContextPredicate'>
      <p> A linked data
        resource that is deemed (by the Server) to be in an Access Context MUST use
        the <code>oslc_acc:accessContext</code> predicate in its RDF representation to
        assert a relation between the linked data resource (subject) and an Access
        Context. </p>
    </section>
    <p> For example, the above RDF statement embedded in the representation of
      resource <code>https://a.example.com/defect/2314</code> asserts that this
      resource is in Access
      Context <code>https://a.example.com/acclist#alpha</code>. The RDF
      representation of a linked data resource in several Access Contexts will have
      multiple such RDF statements; for a linked data resource not in any Access
      Context, there will be none. </p>
  </section>
  <section id='accList'>
    <h2>Access Context List Resource</h2>
    <p> If an Server uses Access Contexts within its resources, the Server MUST
      provide an Access Context List resource. If a Server has more than one Tracked
      Resource Set, it MUST designate an Access Context List resource for each
      Tracked Resource Set; several Tracked Resource Sets MAY share the same Access
      Context List resource. </p>
    <p> The Access Context List resource is intended to be accessed by
      administrator for the purpose of configuring a TRS Client that is working with
      linked data obtained from that Server's Tracked Resource Set. The
      representation of the Access Context resource is itself linked data. </p>
    <section id='ildpGet'>
      <p> The Server MUST support the use
        of the HTTP GET method for the Access Context List resource. The Server SHOULD
        require the use of TLS when making requests to the Access Context List
        resource. The Server SHOULD require authentication for the Access Context List
        resource, and SHOULD allow access only to users with administrative
        privileges. The Server's response MUST support the JSON-LD media type
        (application/ld+json), and MAY support other linked data representations. The
        response SHOULD include an ETag header. </p>
    </section>
    <p> A client uses an HTTP GET request to retrieve a representation of the
      Access Context List resource, specifying JSON-LD as an acceptable format. For
      example: </p>
    <pre class='example'>
GET https://a.example.com/acclist HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/ld+json
Authorization: Basic [missing - admin user credentials]
</pre>
    <section id='accResponce'>
      <p> The response MUST be a
        JSON-LD format string with a node for the Access Context List along with a
        node for each Access Context. The response SHOULD use the simple @graph form
        with a default graph as shown in the example below. The response SHOULD use
        the @context value shown below (i.e., as a boilerplate header), and SHOULD NOT
        use other advanced JSON-LD features, since these can make the response more
        difficult to understand for human readers who only know JSON, and more
        difficult to processed programmatically by scripts without the benefit of a
        full JSON-LD library. The node’s type property gives the type of the node -
        either <code>oslc_acc:AccessContextList</code> or <code>oslc_acc:AccessContext</code>;
        the node’s id property gives the Access Context URI; the title and description
        properties give the title and description, respectively. </p>

      <h2>URI Stability</h2>
      <p> Access Context List and Access Context resources should have stable
        URIs. When Access Context URIs are based on an Access Context List URI with
        the addition of local id in the fragment (e.g., the Access Context
        URI <code>https://a.example.com/acclist#alpha</code> is based on the Access
        Context List URI <code>https://a.example.com/acclist</code>), the Server
        should ensure that each Access Context has a stable local id that is unique
        within the Access Context List. </p>
