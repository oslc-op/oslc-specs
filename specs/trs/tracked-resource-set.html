        The Tracked Resource Set protocol allows a server to expose a set of resources in a way that allows clients to
        discover that set of resources, to track additions to and removals from the set, and to track state changes to
        the resources in the set. The protocol does not assume that clients will dereference the resources, but they
        could do so. The protocol is suitable for dealing with sets containing a large number of resources, as well as
        highly active resource sets that undergo continual change. The protocol is HTTP-based and follows RESTful
        principles.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        An OSLC Tracked Resource Set (TRS) provides a mechanism for making a set of resources discoverable and for
        reporting ongoing changes affecting the set. This allows tools to expose a live feed of linked lifecycle data in
        a way that permits other tools to monitor the tracked resources, aggregate information from multiple sets of
        tracked resources, and maintain live, searchable information based on that linked data.

      <h2>Basic Concepts</h2>
      <p>
        A TRS Server maintains one or more Tracked Resource Sets. The TRS Server decides which particular resources are
        in a particular Tracked Resource Set at any moment; both the Tracked Resource Sets and the linked data contents
        of each Tracked Resource can vary over time. A Tracked Resource Set is represented in terms of a Base and a
        Change Log. The Base is a Linked Data Platform [[!LDP]] Container providing a point-in-time enumeration of the
        Tracked Resource members of the Tracked Resource Set. The Change Log provides a (possibly empty) ordered series
        of adjustments describing changes to the Tracked Resources. When the Base is empty, the Change Log describes a
        history of how the Tracked Resource Set has grown and evolved since its inception. A TRS Server can periodically
        update the Base of a TRS and truncate the Change Log to avoid excessively large Change Logs. Clients can read
        the Base and poll the Change Log to derive and maintain an up-to-date picture of the state of all the Tracked
        Resources in a Tracked Resource Set.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Change Log can contain earlier Change Event entries that would be accounted for by the Base portion. A
        “cutoff” property of the Base identifies the point in the Change Log at which processing of Change Events can be
        cut off because this change and older changes are already included in the Base. TRS Clients use the Base to
        establish an initial set of resources to track, and the Change Log to address changes to that set, and changes
        to the those resources.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="discovery">
      <h2>Discovery</h2>
      <p class="note" title="Discovery is a convenience">
        Discoverability is a convenience; an administrator can configure a Client with a particular Tracked Resource Set
        knowing just the URI of the Server's Tracked Resource Set. Documentation for an TRS Server can describe its
        Tracked Resource Sets, including the URI of each of the Server's Tracked Resource Set resources.
      </p>
      <p class="conformance">
        A Server MAY provide multiple Tracked Resource Sets, and MAY make its Tracked Resource Sets discoverable.
      </p>
      <p class="conformance">
        A <code>trs:trackedResourceSet</code> property MAY be used to declare the whereabouts of a Tracked Resource Set
        resource; the value of such a property MUST be the URI of a Tracked Resource Set.
      </p>
      <p class="informative">
        This allows the existence and location of a Tracked Resource Set resource to be declared with an RDF statement
        like the following (rendered here in Turtle):
      </p>
      <pre class="example">
@prefix trs: &lt;http://open-services.net/ns/core/trs#&gt; .
&lt;&gt; trs:trackedResourceSet &lt;https://a.example.com/trs1&gt; .
    </pre
      >
      <p>
        Where such RDF statements might be found is outside the scope of this specification, but one likely place is a
        root services document; see [[OSLCCore3]], section "Well-known URI Bootstrapping".

        Resource Set, and the Change Log MUST list all changes since that inception.
      </p>
      <p class="conformance">
        Otherwise, the identified Change Event MUST be in the Change Log - that is, there MUST NOT be a gap between the
        Base portion and the Change Log portion of a Tracked Resource Set representation.
      </p>
      <p class="conformance">

        <span class="conformance"
          >For any given tracked resource, the Change Log MUST contain a sufficient sequence of Change Events such that

      <p>
        The ordering of Change Log events is meaningful for changes to any specific resource, but there is no meaning to
        the ordering of change log events for different resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Change Log does not necessarily identify <em>every</em> change of internal state before or during that
        period of time.
      </p>
      <p class="conformance">
        A Server MAY batch up internal changes and add a batch of consolidated Change Events to the Change Log at some
        interval.
      </p>
      <p class="conformance">
        A Server MUST eventually report a change event for a tracked resource if at time <em>t<sub>0</sub></em

        of the Tracked Resource Set is modified, such that a GET on that resource would now return a semantically
        different response from a GET request issued just before <em>t<sub>0</sub></em
        >.
      </p>
      <p class="conformance">
        A Server MAY report a modification event even in cases where there would be no significant difference in
        response.
      </p>
      <p class="conformance">
        When a new resource is added to a tracked resource set, a Server MAY issue a modification event rather than a
        creation event.
      </p>
      <p class="conformance">
        When an existing tracked resource is modified, a Server MAY issue a creation event rather than a modification
        event.
      </p>
      <p class="conformance">
        A Server MAY issue a deletion event for a resource that is not a member of the Tracked Resource Set. This
        includes issuing multiple deletion events for (what was) a member of the Tracked Resource Set.
      </p>
      <p class="conformance">
        When a resource is modified two or more times in rapid succession, a Server MAY elide such modifications by
        reporting only a single creation or modification event in the Change Log.
      </p>
      <p class="conformance">
        When a resource is created and deleted in rapid succession, a Server MAY omit all Change Events for that
        resource.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of the highly dynamic nature of the Resource Set and the difficulty of enumerating an exact set of
        resources at a precise point in time,
        <span class="conformance"
          >a Server MAY produce a Base that is only an approximation of the Tracked Resource Set membership</span

        have been omitted.
        <span class="conformance"

      </p>
      <p class="informative">
        From the above sections, one can infer that the consistency and completeness of the change log with respect to
        the date on a TRS Server is only possible after reading the entire Base and Change Log. A client cannot skip the
        initial reading of the base, nor partially consume a Change Log, and then expect consistency with some earlier
        point-in-time of the server’s data.

        A Server MUST NOT move a change event from one segment of a segmented change log to an earlier segment in the
        chain, one with more recent change events.
      </p>
      <p class="conformance">
        A Server MAY move a change event from one segment of a segmented change log to an later segment in the chain,
        one with older change events.
      </p>
      <p class="informative, note">
        The above implies that a client could see the same change event more than once. Since each change event has a
        unique URI, clients can detect such repetition, and ignore duplicate events.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="conformance">A Server MAY remove a change event from the change log</span>, perhaps because that

        However, to avoid maintaining this ever growing list of Change Logs indefinitely,
        <span class="conformance">a Server MAY truncate the Change Log at a suitable point in the chain</span>. This can
        be accomplished by deleting the oldest segments of the Change Log and/or by removing
        <code>trs:previous</code> links that reference them, and/or by removing obsolete Change Events from the end of
        the Change Log.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        TRS Servers can therefore return HTTP status code 404 (Not found) when navigating the "previous" reference from
        a final or stale Change Log segment; clients should interpret this as indicating that they have reached the end
        of the change log.
      </p>
      <p>
        To ensure that a new Client can always get started,
        <span class="conformance">the Change Log MUST contain the base cutoff event of the corresponding Base</span>,
        and all Change Events more recent than it. Thus the Server is only allowed to truncate Change Events older than

          When calculating a new Base, the TRS Server SHOULD retain Change Events before the new cutoff event that a

          When producing multiple segments of a new Base, the TRS Server MUST NOT reuse URIs from segments of a previous

    <section id="timescales" class="informative">
      <h2>Timescales and event frequency</h2>
      <p>
        In order to provide adequate response to client requests, a TRS server needs to allow those clients sufficient
        time to read the base, the change log, and process the set of tracked resources. However, the data volumes and
        timescales involved in TRS processing are likely to vary between servers for different applications. A server
        representing Amazon transactions might have many events per second, while a server representing exhibits at a
        museum might have a few events per month. The cost of processing a single event is also likely to vary between
        applications; reading a new or modified resource with 5 RDF properties will take less time than reading one with
        5,000 properties.
      </p>
      <p>
        For these reasons, the TRS specification does not impose specific constraints over the length of time for which
        a TRS base needs to remain readable, nor what the degree of overlap should be between a base and a corresponding
        change log. A server implementing TRS needs to consider, and should document, the quality of service it will
        provide in terms of the size of pages in the base or change log, how long base pages are kept, how long change
        events are kept, and the minimum period for which change events behind the latest base cutoff are kept.

      <h2>TRS Examples</h2>
      <p>
        In this example of a change log, time stamps are used to generate unique URNs for the Change Event URIs; other
        ways of generating a unique URI are also possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that the actual time of change is not included in a Change Event. Only a sequence number, representing the
