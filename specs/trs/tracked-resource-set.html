        The Tracked Resource Set protocol allows a server to expose a set of resources in a way that allows clients to
        discover that set of resources, to track additions to and removals from the set, and to track state changes to
        the resources in the set. The protocol does not assume that clients will dereference the resources, but they
        could do so. The protocol is suitable for dealing with sets containing a large number of resources, as well as
        highly active resource sets that undergo continual change. The protocol is HTTP-based and follows RESTful
        principles.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        An OSLC Tracked Resource Set (TRS) provides a mechanism for making a set of resources discoverable and for
        reporting ongoing changes affecting the set. This allows tools to expose a live feed of linked lifecycle data in
        a way that permits other tools to monitor the tracked resources, aggregate information from multiple sets of
        tracked resources, and maintain live, searchable information based on that linked data.

      <h2>Basic Concepts</h2>
      <p>
        A TRS Server maintains one or more Tracked Resource Sets. The TRS Server decides which particular resources are
        in a particular Tracked Resource Set at any moment; both the Tracked Resource Sets and the linked data contents
        of each Tracked Resource can vary over time. A Tracked Resource Set is represented in terms of a Base and a
        Change Log. The Base is a Linked Data Platform [[!LDP]] Container providing a point-in-time enumeration of the
        Tracked Resource members of the Tracked Resource Set. The Change Log provides a (possibly empty) ordered series
        of adjustments describing changes to the Tracked Resources. When the Base is empty, the Change Log describes a
        history of how the Tracked Resource Set has grown and evolved since its inception. A TRS Server can periodically
        update the Base of a TRS and truncate the Change Log to avoid excessively large Change Logs. Clients can read
        the Base and poll the Change Log to derive and maintain an up-to-date picture of the state of all the Tracked
        Resources in a Tracked Resource Set.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Change Log can contain earlier Change Event entries that would be accounted for by the Base portion. A
        “cutoff” property of the Base identifies the point in the Change Log at which processing of Change Events can be
        cut off because this change and older changes are already included in the Base. TRS Clients use the Base to
        establish an initial set of resources to track, and the Change Log to address changes to that set, and changes
        to the those resources.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="discovery">
      <h2>Discovery</h2>
      <p class="note" title="Discovery is a convenience">
        Discoverability is a convenience; an administrator can configure a Client with a particular Tracked Resource Set
        knowing just the URI of the Server's Tracked Resource Set. Documentation for an TRS Server can describe its
        Tracked Resource Sets, including the URI of each of the Server's Tracked Resource Set resources.
      </p>
      <p class="conformance">
        A Server MAY provide multiple Tracked Resource Sets, and MAY make its Tracked Resource Sets discoverable.
      </p>
      <p class="conformance">
        A <code>trs:trackedResourceSet</code> property MAY be used to declare the whereabouts of a Tracked Resource Set
        resource; the value of such a property MUST be the URI of a Tracked Resource Set.
      </p>
      <p class="informative">
        This allows the existence and location of a Tracked Resource Set resource to be declared with an RDF statement
        like the following:
      </p>
      <pre class="example" title="Discovery Statement">
@prefix trs: &lt;http://open-services.net/ns/core/trs#&gt; .
&lt;&gt; trs:trackedResourceSet &lt;https://a.example.com/trs1&gt; .
    </pre
      >
      <p>
        Where such RDF statements might be found is outside the scope of this specification. See also [[OSLCCore3]],
        section "Well-known URI Bootstrapping".

    </section>
    <section id="general-behavior">
      <h2>General Behavior</h2>
      <p class="conformance">
        The TRS Server MUST support GET requests conformant with [[OSLCCore2]] or [[OSLCCore3]] for Tracked Resource
        Sets, Base resources, and Change Logs.
      </p>
      <p class="conformance">
        The RDF returned for Tracked Resource Sets, Base resources, Change Logs, MUST conform to the shapes and
        constraints in the following section.
      </p>
      <p class="conformance">The TRS Server SHOULD support ETags, caching, and conditional GETs for those resources.</p>
      <p class="conformance">
        Servers providing the tracked resources referenced by a Tracked Resource Set MUST also support GET requests
        conformant with [[OSLCCore2]] or [[OSLCCore3]] and SHOULD support ETags, caching, and conditional GETs for those
        resources.

      <p>
        <a href="tracked-resource-set-vocab.html">OSLC TRS Version 3.0. Part 2: Vocabulary</a> and
        <a href="tracked-resource-set-shapes.html"> OSLC TRS Version 3.0. Part 3: Constraints</a> define the vocabulary
        terms and constraints for OSLC Change Management resources. These terms and constraints are specified according
        to [OSLCCore3].
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="cutoff-event">
      <h2>Cutoff Event</h2>
      <p>
        The cutoff event in the Base marks the point in the Change Log at which this change and all earlier changes have
        already been accounted for in the Base.
      </p>

      <p class="conformance">
        If the cutoff property is missing, or if it has the value <code>rdf:nil</code>, the Base enumerates the
        (possibly empty) Resource Set at the inception of the Tracked Resource Set, and the Change Log MUST list all
        changes since that inception.
      </p>
      <p class="conformance">
        Otherwise, the identified Change Event MUST be in the Change Log - that is, there MUST NOT be a discontinuity
        between the Base portion and the Change Log portion of a Tracked Resource Set.
      </p>
      <p class="conformance">
        Conversely, the Change Log MAY contain earlier Change Event entries that have been accounted for in the Base.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="change-logs">
      <h2>Change Logs and Creation or Modification Events</h2>
      <p class="conformance">
        A Server MUST refer to a given Tracked Resource using the exact same URI in the Base membership property and
        every Change Event (<code>trs:changed</code> reference) for that resource.
      </p>
      <p>
        A Change Log represents a series of changes to the corresponding Tracked Resource Set over some period of time.
        <span class="conformance"
          >For any given tracked resource, the Change Log MUST contain a sufficient sequence of Change Events such that
          processing the Base and the Change Log gives a consistent and complete picture of the Tracked Resources at the
          end of that period of time.</span
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        The ordering of Change Log events is meaningful for changes to any specific resource, but there is no meaning to
        the ordering of change log events for different resources.
        <span class="conformance"
          >That is, a change event for resource <code>R1</code> at time <code>t</code> MAY have an order number that is
          greater than a change to an unrelated resource <code>R2</code> at time <code>t+1</code></span
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Change Log does not necessarily identify <em>every</em> change of state before or during that period of
        time, as further explained in the following paragraphs.
      </p>
      <p class="conformance">
        A Server MAY batch up changes and add a batch of consolidated Change Events to the Change Log at some interval.
      </p>
      <p class="conformance">
        A Server MUST eventually report a change event for a tracked resource if at time <em>t<sub>0</sub></em
        >, a tracked resource is added to the Tracked Resource Set, deleted from the Tracked Resource Set, or the state
        of the Tracked Resource Set is modified, such that a GET on that resource would now return a semantically
        different response from a GET request issued just before <em>t<sub>0</sub></em
        >.
      </p>
      <p class="conformance">
        When a resource is modified two or more times in rapid succession, a Server MAY elide such modifications by
        reporting only a single creation or modification event in the Change Log.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="conformance"
          >A Server MAY report a modification event even in cases where there would be no significant difference in
          response.</span
        >
        This could happen because a resource was modified and then that change was reverted in a second modification;
        the first modification could be elided in the change log.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no difference between change events with RDF type <code>trs:Creation</code> and
        <code>trs:Modification</code>; the two types exist for historical reasons.
        <span class="conformance"
          >When a new resource is modified or added to a tracked resource set, a Server MAY issue a modification event
          or a creation event</span
        >; as described earlier,
        <span class="conformance">the server MUST eventually issue at least one such event</span>.
      </p>
      <p class="conformance">
        When a resource is created and deleted in rapid succession, a Server MAY omit all Change Events for that
        resource.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of the highly dynamic nature of the Resource Set and the difficulty of enumerating an exact set of
        resources at a precise point in time,
        <span class="conformance"
          >a Server MAY produce a Base that is only an approximation of the Tracked Resource Set membership</span
        >. A Base might omit mention of a Resource that ought to have been included or include a Resource that ought to
        have been omitted.
        <span class="conformance"
          >For each such inconsistency in the Base, the Server MUST at some point include a corrective Change Event in
          the Change Log more recent than the base cutoff event</span
        >, allowing a client to compute the correct set of Tracked Resources.
      </p>
      <p class="conformance">
        A Server MAY issue a deletion event for a resource that is not a member of the Tracked Resource Set. This
        includes issuing multiple deletion events for (what was) a member of the Tracked Resource Set. This might happen
        when the base is being recalculated, and the change log slightly overlaps the base, or as part of the corrective
        set of change events described in the previous paragraph.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        From the above sections, one can infer that the consistency and completeness of the change log with respect to
        the data on a TRS Server is only possible (but is not guaranteed) after reading the entire Base and Change Log.
        A client cannot skip the initial reading of the base, nor partially consume a Change Log, and then expect
        consistency with some earlier point-in-time of the server’s data. Even having read the entire base plus change
        log, a client may still not have information on the most recent changes to the tracked resources; nor is there
        any guarantee that the result represents an exact state of the server's data at any specific point in time.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="change-log-segments">
      <h2>Change Log Segmentation</h2>
      <p>
        The number of Change Events in the Change Log can grow to a point where it is not reasonable to contain all the
        Change Events in a single HTTP response. In this case,
        <span class="conformance"
          >the most recent Change Event resources MUST be included in the RDF representation of the Tracked Resource Set
          itself</span
        >, and
        <span class="conformance"
          >earlier events MAY be segmented into separate Change Log resources referenced from the
          <code>trs:previous</code> property</span
        >.
      </p>
      <p class="conformance">
        There can be any number of such Change Log segments. The events in a Change Log segment MUST all have order
        numbers higher than any events in any subsequent Change Log segments.
      </p>
      <p class="conformance">
        Just as the most recent Change Events MUST be included inline in the HTTP response for the Change Log in the
        Tracked Resource Set resource itself, TRS Servers MUST include the Change Event resources for each Change Log
        segment inline in the RDF representation of the HTTP response for the Change Log segment.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        The above paragraphs allows a Client to discover the most recent Change Events, retrieve successively older
        Change Log resources until it encounters a Change Event that has already been processed (on a previous check),

      <p class="conformance">
        A Server MAY move a change event from one segment of a segmented change log to an later segment in the chain,

      </p>
      <p class="informative, note">
        The above implies that a client could see the same change event more than once. Since each change event has a
        unique URI, clients can detect such repetition, and ignore duplicate events.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="conformance">A Server MAY remove a change event from the change log</span>, perhaps because that

        However, to avoid maintaining this ever growing list of Change Logs indefinitely,
        <span class="conformance">a Server MAY truncate the Change Log at a suitable point in the chain</span>. This can
        be accomplished by deleting the oldest segments of the Change Log and/or by removing
        <code>trs:previous</code> links that reference them, and/or by removing obsolete Change Events from the end of
        the Change Log.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        TRS Servers can therefore return HTTP status code 404 (Not found) when navigating the "previous" reference from
        a final or stale Change Log segment; clients should interpret this as indicating that they have reached the end
        of the change log.
      </p>
      <p>
        To ensure that a new Client can always get started,
        <span class="conformance">the Change Log MUST contain the base cutoff event of the corresponding Base</span>,

          When producing multiple segments of a new Base, the TRS Server MUST NOT reuse URIs from segments of a previous

    <section id="timescales" class="informative">
      <h2>Timescales and event frequency</h2>
      <p>
        In order to provide adequate response to client requests, a TRS server needs to allow those clients sufficient
        time to read the base, the change log, and process the set of tracked resources. However, the data volumes and
        timescales involved in TRS processing are likely to vary between servers for different applications. A server
        representing Amazon transactions might have many events per second, while a server representing exhibits at a
        museum might have a few events per month. The cost of processing a single event is also likely to vary between
        applications; reading a new or modified resource with 5 RDF properties will take less time than reading one with
        5,000 properties.
      </p>
      <p>
        For these reasons, the TRS specification does not impose specific constraints over the length of time for which
        a TRS base needs to remain readable, nor what the degree of overlap should be between a base and a corresponding
        change log. A server implementing TRS needs to consider, and should document, the quality of service it will
        provide in terms of the size of pages in the base or change log, how long base pages are kept, how long change
        events are kept, and the minimum period for which change events behind the latest base cutoff are kept.

        In this example of a change log, time stamps are used to generate unique URNs for the Change Event URIs; other
        ways of generating a unique URI are also possible.
