      <h2>Motivation and Use Cases for Patch Events</h2>
      <p>
        For a Resource that changes frequently, a typical Client may retrieve the same Resource over and over again.
        When the representation of the Resource is large and the differences between adjacent representations can be
        described compactly, including additional information in the trs:Modification Change Event can allow the Client
        to determine the Resource’s current representation and thereby avoid having to retrieve the Resource.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, in versioned worlds each change to a versioned resource may result in the creation of a new Resource
        representing an immutable version of the resource. The typical Client retrieves each such Resource as it is
        created. The state of the new Resource is often quite similar to the state of a Resource corresponding to a
        previous version. When the state of one Resource is similar to that of another Resource and the differences
        between the two can be described compactly, including additional information in the trs:Creation Change Event
        can allow the Client to determine the new Resource’s resultant state from the potentially-known state of a
        previously-retrieved Resource and thereby avoid having to retrieve the new Resource.

      <h2>General Guidance</h2>
      <p>
        The following sections provide some general guidance on how to servers provide and clients can consume Tracked
        Resource Sets.
      </p>
      <section id="localReplica" class="informative">
        <h2>Building a Local Replica</h2>
        <p>
          This section describes one (relatively straightforward) way that a Client can use the Tracked Resource Set
          protocol to build and maintain its own local replica of a Server’s Resource Set.
        </p>
        <section id="initializationProcedure" class="informative">
          <h2>Initialization procedure</h2>
          <p>
            A Client wishing to determine the complete collection of Resources in a Server’s Resource Set, so that it
            can build its local replica of the Resource Set, proceeds as follows:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Send a GET request to the Tracked Resource Set URI to retrieve the Tracked Resource Set representation to
              learn the URI of the Base.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use GET to retrieve successive pages of the Base, adding each of the member Resources to the Client’s
              local replica of the Resource Set.
            </li>
            <li>
              Invoke the Incremental Update procedure (below). The sync point event is the
              <code>trs:cutoffEvent</code> property (on the first page of the Base). A clever Client might run this step
              in parallel with the previous one in an effort to prevent the case where the Client can’t catch up to the
              current state of the Resource Set using the Change Log (after initial processing) because initial
              processing takes too long.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The overall work to build the local replica of the Resource Set is linear in the size of the Base plus the
            number of Change Events that occurred after the base cutoff event. The Server can help Clients building new
            local replicas of its Resource Set by providing as recent a Base as possible, because that means the Client
            will have to process fewer Change Events. It is entirely up to the Server how often it computes a new Base.
            It is also up to the Server how it computes the members of a Base, whether by enumerating its Resource Set
            directly (e.g., by querying an underlying database), or perhaps by coalescing its internal change log
            entries into a previous base.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="incrementalUpdateProcedure" class="informative">
          <h2>Incremental update procedure</h2>
          <p>
            Suppose now that a Client has a local replica of the Server’s Resource Set that is accurate as of a
            particular sync point event known to the Client. A Client wishing to update its local replica of the
            Server’s Resource Set acts as follows:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Send a GET request to the Tracked Resource Set URI to retrieve the Tracked Resource Set representation to
              learn its current Change Log.
            </li>
            <li>
              Search through the chain of Change Logs from newest to oldest to find the sync point event. The
              incremental update fails if the Client is unable to locate the sync point (i.e., it gets to the end of the
              log).
            </li>
            <li>
              Process all Change Events after the sync point event, from oldest to newest, making corresponding changes
              to the Client’s local replica of the Resource Set. Record the latest event processed as the new sync point
              event. A clever Client might record (some number of) recently processed events for possible future undo in
              the event of a server rollback.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            When the procedure succeeds, the Client will have updated its own local replica of the Server’s Resource Set
            to be an accurate reflection of the set of resources as described by the retrieved representation of the
            Tracked Resource Set. Of course, the Server’s actual Resource Set may have undergone additional changes
            since then. While the Client may never catch up to the Server, it can at least keep its local replica of the
            Resource Set almost up to date. By choosing the interval at which it polls for updates, a Client controls
            how long the two are allowed to drift apart. The overall work to maintain the local replica of the Resource
            Set is linear in the length of the Change Event stream. In the (hopefully rare) situation that the Client
            fails to find its sync point event, one of two things is likely to have happened on the Server: either the
            Server has truncated its Change Log, or the Server has been rolled back to an earlier state.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the Client had been retaining a local record of previously processed events, the Client may be able to
            detect a Server rollback if it notices the successor event of some previously processed event has been
            removed or changed to one with a different identifier than before. In this case, the Client can undo changes
            to its local replica back to that sync point, and then pick up processing from there.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once the Incremental Update procedure fails, it is unlikely to succeed in the future. The Client has reached
            an impasse. The Client’s only way forward is to discard its local replica and start over.
          </p>

        <h2>General Guidance for TRS Servers</h2>
        <p>
          There are a number of possible ways that a lifecycle tool could go about exposing its linked lifecycle data.
          Here is some general guidance:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p class="ednote" title="TBD">
              <strong>Editor: These seem unwarranted reactions to a percieved usability problem. (img)</strong>
            </p>
            A TRS Server should restrict itself to a small number of Tracked Resource Sets. When configuring a TRS
            Client, an administrator will typically have to select Tracked Resource Sets one at a time.
          </li>
          <li>
            A TRS Server should restrict itself to a static set of Tracked Resource Sets. When a Server Tracked Resource
            Set gets created dynamically, the administrator would be required to update the configurations of affected
            Clients.
          </li>
          <li>
            A Server’s Tracked Resource Sets should contain pairwise-disjoint sets of Tracked Resources. That is, a
            resource should not appear as a Resource in more than one Tracked Resource Set. A Server should document any
            overlap between its Tracked Resource Sets. (Some Clients are unable to work with overlapping Tracked
            Resource Sets.)
          </li>
          <li>
            A Server’s Resources should be linked data resources under the control of the Server itself, rather than
            linked data resources of some other lifecycle tool. In other words, a lifecycle tool should expose its own
            resources, not those of others.
          </li>
          <li>
            The RDF content of a Server's Resources should be statements about linked data resources under the control
            of the Server itself, rather than statements about linked data resources of some other lifecycle tool. In
            other words, the subjects of a lifecycle tool claims should be its own resources, as opposed to resources of
            some other lifecycle tool.
          </li>
          <li>
            A Tracked Resource may be one of the Server's regular linked lifecycle data resources, or it may be a
            resource containing an RDF data graph used specifically for exposing some linked data in a Tracked Resource
            Set.
          </li>
          <li>
            A Server should expose all of its linked lifecycle data via Tracked Resources in one of its Tracked Resource
            Sets. Any information that is held back will be unavailable to Clients.
          </li>
          <li>A Server’s combined RDF dataset should not repeat the same RDF statements.</li>
          <li>A Serv’s combined RDF dataset should not contain contradictory RDF statements.</li>
          <li>
            It is recommended that a Server report changes to its linked lifecycle data (including resource creations,
            deletions, and modifications) within 1 second of the changes being committed. Changes are reported via the
            Server's Tracked Resource Set Change Log. This helps ensure that Clients are able to obtain a live feed of
            changes in nearly real-time.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is recommended that a Server’s Tracked Resource Set include a Base not older than 7 days. This helps
            ensure that Clients are able to initially determine the resources in the set without having to process
            Change Events older than 7 days.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is recommended that a Server’s Tracked Resource Set Change Log retain Change Events for at least 7 days.
            This helps ensure that there are sufficient Change Events to allow a Client to catch up after a lengthy
            downtime or network outage.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <section id="consumerGuidance" class="informative">
        <h2>General Guidance for TRS Clients</h2>
        <p>
          A TRS Client does is akin to what a Web crawler does, and most of the same considerations apply.
        </p>
        <p>
          A Client retrieves the TRS, Change Logs, and Base Resources, as well as some or all the Tracked Resources
          contained in the TRS. Except for the TRS Resource URI itself, the Client is blindly retrieving a succession of
          URIs that the Server includes in the Tracked Resource Set. An insufficiently wary Client can come to grief
          when it interacts with an imperfect or untrustworthy Server.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of the risks are always present: networks connecting Client to Server may experience delays and outages;
          and Server implementations may be imperfect (bugs in code, database corruptions). Moreover, when the Server is
          untrusted - when there is a concern the Server could attempt something nefarious - the Client needs to take
          extra steps to prevent itself from being misused or abused.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are risks and general guidance for Clients:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The size and rate of change of a Server's resource set reflects the amount of linked data that a Server has
            to make available and how often that data changes. These vary considerably and are often difficult to
            estimate in advance. A Client that is maintaining a copy of a Server's Tracked Resources should establish
            reasonable limits and monitor the size and rate of change so that a misbehaving Server does not cause the
            Client to spend an unreasonable amount of effort (network communication and storage) in doing so. This
            should include caps on the number and representation sizes of resources (including TRS Change Logs and TRS
            Base pages, for example).
          </li>
          <li>
            Since the Client is retrieving resources of various kinds over the network from the Server, which takes time
            and network connections, the Client should do so in a way that does not prevent it from doing other useful
            work while waiting for responses. The Client should be tolerant of failures due to network failures and
            outages, and carry over important work until the blockage has been removed. On the other hand, the Client
            should not allow its queue of work to grow without bound since that may make it difficult for the Client to
            clear the backlog. The Client should also be polite to the Server, and avoid making multiple requests per
            second and/or downloading large files that might make it hard for the Server to keep up with its normal
            workload.
          </li>
          <li>
            A Server’s Resources should be linked data resources under the control of the Server itself, rather than
            linked data resources of some other lifecycle tool. A Client that does not trust a Server in this regard
            should mitigate the risk by keeping a server whitelist for each Server and refusing to retrieve the
            Resources of a given Server when the server is not on the whitelist. Without something like this, a Client
            can be tricked into retrieving and indexing resources that it should not, such as other resources located on
            a different server that the Client also happens to have access to.
          </li>
          <li>
            The RDF content of a Tracked Resource should be statements about linked data resources under the control of
            the Server itself, rather than statements about linked data resources of some other lifecycle tool. In other
            words, the subjects of a lifecycle tool claims should be its own resources, as opposed to resources of some
            other lifecycle tool. A Client that does not trust a Server in this regard should mitigate the risk by
            keeping a content whitelist for each Server and rejecting the RDF content of Tracked Resources of a given
            Server when the URIs of subjects are not all on the content whitelist. Without something like this, a Server
            can affect a Client with arbitrary claims which may interfere with or contradict authoritative claims made
            by the legitimate owner.

      <section id="accGuidance" class="informative">
        <h2>Access Context Guidance</h2>
        <p>
          There are several things to consider when deciding how a lifecycle tool can make use of Access Contexts.
          Before suggesting possible designs, here are some characteristics that will help ensure a lifecycle tool will
          be useful to administrators tasked with configuring access to the Tracked Resources that have been retreived
          by a TRS Client:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Optional</b>. A Server should only use Access Contexts if there are reasons why an administrator might
            want to impose differential access in Clients.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Understandable</b>. An administrator should be able to intuit from the Access Context name and
            description what kinds of resources are in it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Useful collections</b>. An Access Context should contain resources that can be treated similarly. Same
            security classification. An Access Context should contain resources with the same security classification.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Reasonable number</b>. The list of Access Contexts should not be so long as to overwhelm the
            administrator.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Stable</b>. The set of Access Contexts should be more or less static. Changes to the Access Context list
            will generally require the administrator to update configurations of Clients.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Centralized</b>. A Server should host a single Access Context List resource enumerating the Access
            Contexts used in any of its Tracked Resources, unless there are reasons to do otherwise.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The following recipes suggest some of the designs that are possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Recipe 1</b>: Your tool has top-level objects called workspaces. New workspaces are created infrequently,
          and only by administrators. Each linked data resource is associated with a single workspace. Teams of users
          work in the context of a single workspace. All the resources in a workspace have the same security
          classification.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your tool should treat each workspace as a separate Tracked Resource Set, and not use Access Contexts.

          An administrator can always control access to the linked data in a Client on an TRS by TRS basis, and grant
          users access to linked data from some workspaces but not others.

        <p>
          <b>Recipe 2</b>: Your tool has top-level objects called projects. New projects are created infrequently, and
          only by administrators. Each linked data resource is associated with a single project. Teams of users work in
          the context of a set of projects. All the resources in a project have the same security classification.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your tool should treat all projects as part of a single Resource Set, and automatically create Access Contexts
          in 1-1 correspondence with projects, taking on the name and description of the project.

          Your tool should have a single Tracked Resource Set. Your tool should let an administrator define a set of

          these Access Contexts.

        <h2>TRS Patch Guidance</h2>
        <p>
          The following sections provide general guidlines on using the TRS Patch capability.

          <h3>TRS Patch Guidance for Servers</h3>
          <p>
            When the state of a Tracked Resource changes, the Server adds a <code>trs:Modification</code> Change Event
            to a Change Log. The Change Event describes a transition between two definite representations states of the
            Tracked Resource. In principle, the entity tags of the two states, and the LD patch between the two RDF
            representations, are all well-defined. This much is true whether or not the Server chooses to embed those
            pieces of information in the Change Event.
          </p>
          <p>
            The decision as to whether to provide an LD Patch for a <code>trs:Modification</code> Change Event should be
            made on a case-by-case basis. Just because one Change Event for a resource includes an LD Patch, that does
            not mean that all Change Events for the same resource should also include an LD Patch.
          </p>
          <p>
            Server developers should remember that a Client wishing to discover the current state of a resource can
            always do so using HTTP GET to retrieve the resource. Including an LD Patch in a Change Event is an optional
            embellishment that allows some Client under the right circumstances to determine the new current state of a
            resource instead of re-retrieving the resource. It is up to the Server to decide whether including an LD
            patch is likely to be worthwhile.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, whenever a <code>trs:Modification</code> Change Event includes a <code>trspatch:rdfPatch</code>, it
            should also include accurate <code>trspatch:beforeETag</code> and
            <code>trspatch:afterETag</code> properties. Without all 3 pieces of information, a Client is unlikely to be
            able to do better than re-retrieving the resource to discover its updated state.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the RDF representation of the resource contains a large number of RDF triples and the number of rows in
            the LD Patch is small, including the LD patch in the Change Event is recommended, and may improve overall
            system performance by allowing Clients to avoid having to re-retrieve the resource to discover its updated
            state. Similiarly, whenever a <code>trs:Creation</code> Change Event includes a
            <code>trspatch:rdfPatch</code>, it should also include a <code>trspatch:createdFrom</code> along with
            accurate <code>trspatch:beforeETag</code> and <code>trspatch:afterETag</code> properties.
          </p>
          <p>
            Conversely, when the number of affected RDF triples is large, the size of the LD Patch becomes significant.
            Including the LD Patch in the Change Event is not recommended because it bloats the size of Change Events in
            the Change Log, which may negatively impact performance. Omitting the LD patch from the Change Event is
            likely to give better overall performance.

          <h3>TRS Patch Guidance for Clients</h3>
          <p>
            A typical Client is tracking the state of some or all Tracked Resources in a Resource Set. When the Client
            first discovers the Resource, whether through a <code>trs:Creation</code> Change Event in the Change Log or
            an entry in the Base, the Client uses HTTP GET to retrieve the current state of the Resource and gets back
            its RDF representation. When the response includes an entity tag for the resource in its current state, as
            it will when the Index Resource is a LDP-RS, the Client remembers both the RDF representation and entity tag
            as the state of that Index Resource.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the Client processes a <code>trs:Modification</code> Change Event for the Resource in the Change Log,
            it learns that the Resource has changed state. This means that the Client’s remembered RDF representation
            and entity tag for the Resource are no longer accurate, which cues the Client to discard the remembered RDF
            representation and re-retrieve the Resource. However, when the Change Event includes a TRS Patch, the Client
            may have a second option. When the <code>trspatch:beforeETag</code> value matches the Client’s remembered
            entity tag, the Client can apply the <code>trspatch:rdfPatch</code> to its remembered RDF representation to
            compute a replacement RDF representation, which can be remembered along with the
            <code>trspatch:afterETag</code> value as the entity tag. When this happens, the Client can process the
            <code>trs:Modification</code> Change Event for the Resource without a network request. It is clearly
            advantageous for a Client to behave this way whenever possible. On the other hand, if the
            <code>trspatch:beforeETag</code> value does not match the Client’s remembered entity tag, the Client cannot
            apply the <code>trspatch:rdfPatch</code>, and should treat the Change Event as if the TRS Patch were absent.
          </p>
          <p>
            Similarly, when the Client processes a <code>trs:Creation</code> Change Event for the Resource in the Change
            Log of the Tracked Resource Set, the Client learns of the existence of a new Resource. This cues the Client
            to retrieve the new Resource. However, when the Change Event includes a TRS Patch, the Client may have a
            second option. When the Clienthas previously retrieved and remembered the resource identified by
            <code>trspatch:createdFrom</code> in the state with entity tag matching <code>trspatch:beforeETag</code>,
            the Client can apply the <code>trspatch:rdfPatch</code> to the Client’s remembered RDF representation to
            compute an RDF representation of the new Resource, which can be remembered along with the
            <code>trspatch:afterETag</code> value as the entity tag. When this happens, the Client can process the
            <code>trs:Modification</code> Change Event for the Resource without having to retrieve the new Resource. It
            is clearly advantageous for a Clientto behave this way whenever possible. On the other hand, if the
            <code>trspatch:beforeETag</code> value does not match the Client’s remembered entity tag, the Client cannot
            apply the <code>trspatch:rdfPatch</code> and should treat the Change Event as if the TRS Patch were absent.
          </p>
          <p>
            Risk-wise, TRS Patches provide a way for a Server to tamper with the RDF representations of another server’s
            resources in a Client without the other server’s involvement. The mitigations covered in General Guidance
            for Clients, above, will address this risk as well. The Clients’s server whitelist for an untrusted Tracked
            Resource Set should be used to vet <code>trspatch:createdFrom</code> URIs, and its content whitelist should
            be used to vet subjects in the results of applying TRS patches.
