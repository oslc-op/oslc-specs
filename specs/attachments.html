<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Various tools handle the association and creation of related resources in
    conceptually similar ways, but often differ in details on how it is
    accomplished.  The Linked Data Platform (LDP) already defines a model by which it
    is possible to relate resources to another, even if they are not RDF-based.
    This specification defines the method to create associated attachments to a
    given resource and understand if that resource supports the attaching of
    attachments.</p>
<p>As an example of how to create an attachment, simply HTTP POST the attachment content to the attachment
    container for the resource. The request should have a
    <code>Content-Type</code> header describing the attachment's media type.
    The optional <code>Slug</code> header is used to give the attachment a
    name.</p>

<pre class="example">
POST /bugs/2314/attachments HTTP/1.1
Slug: design
Content-Type: application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.text
Content-Length: 18124

[binary content]
</pre>

<p>The response contains a Link to the new attachment in the
    <code>Location</code> header. This server has also included a Link to the
    <code>oslc:AttachmentDescriptor</code> for the attachment in the HTTP
    response, which contains metadata about the attachment.</p>

<pre class="example">
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Allow: GET,HEAD,OPTIONS,POST
Location: http://example.com/bugs/2314/attachments/3
Link: &lt;http://example.com/bugs/2314/attachments/meta/3&gt;; rel="describedby"; anchor="http://example.com/bugs/2314/attachments/3",

<p>The following sections detail how to leverage LDP to accomplish the ways in which to
discovery, get, create, update or delete attachments and associate with a web resource.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Most users of lifecycle tools have the need to easily create attachments across a variety of integrated tools and associate them
to some lifecycle resource in context to some scenario.  Some specific scenarios where this touches cross tool integration:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Running application scanning</strong> : automatically creating a defect or task to track a problem,
	attaching a log file that outlines the details of the problem.</li>
	<li><strong>Publishing build results</strong> : as part of an automated software build, publish successful build artifacts
	to an asset management repository</li>
	<li><strong>Mockups of app design</strong> : share screenshots and designs to a given user story (requirement) </li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id='concepts' class='informative'>
<h2>Basic Concepts</h2>
<!-- TODO: Consider adding a simple diagram showing relationship from: resource->(container & member properties)->attachdescriptor -->
<p>Attachments are added to a resource via a simple POST request to the
    appropriate LDP-Container resource. The entity body becomes the content of
    the attachment resource. The attachment may automatically be associated with
    the resource via some membership relationship, which may use the <code>oslc:attachment</code> membership predicate.
    Statements are also automatically added to the
    <code>oslc:AttachmentDescriptor</code> resource. The property values are
    assigned by the server or can be determined from standard headers of
    the POST.  The following table maps the HTTP request headers from the POST
    request to create the attachment resource, to what can
    be used to derive the initial values in the indicated
    <code>oslc:AttachmentDescriptor</code> resource:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th><strong>HTTP Request Header</strong></th>
  <th><strong>Prefixed Name</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td><code>Slug</code></td>
  <td><code>dcterms:title</code></td>

<section id="examples" class="informative">
<h2>Working with Attachments</h2>

The following examples illustrate how a client can work with attachments.

<section id="ex_get_attachment">
<h2>Find the Attachments for a Resource</h2>

<p>Clients get the attachments for a resource by:</p>

<ol>
<li>Finding the attachment container for a resource using an HTTP OPTIONS method and Link header</li>
<li>Getting the container for the list of attachments</li>
</ol>

<p>Each resource that supports attachments has an attachment container, which
    is an LDP container. Clients discover the attachment container through an
    HTTP Link header. A client can use GET or HEAD to get the Link header, but
    OPTIONS is often more efficient because the server does not have to
    calculate the ETag or content length of the response. LDP resources must
    support HTTP OPTIONS, and responses to all HTTP requests for resources that
    support attachments must have the Link header.</p>

<pre class="example">
OPTIONS /bugs/2314 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
</pre>

<p>The response contains a Link to the attachment container with Link relation
    <code>http://open-services.net/ns/core#AttachmentContainer</code>. Note
    that other Link headers are in the response. In fact, LDP requires
    additional Link headers, which is why the response has a Link with relation
    <code>type</code> and target URI
    <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Resource</code>.</p>

<pre class="example">
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Allow: GET,HEAD,OPTIONS,PUT,DELETE
Link: &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Resource&gt;; rel="type",
      &lt;http://example.com/bugs/2314/attachments&gt;; rel="http://open-services.net/ns/core#AttachmentContainer"
</pre>

<p>Now the client requests the attachment container to see the attachments for
    this resource. It's a good practice to include an HTTP <code>Prefer</code>
    header to explicitly ask the server for the LDP containment triples.</p>

<pre class="example">
GET /bugs/2314/attachments HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Accept: text/turtle
Prefer: return=representation; include="http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#PreferContainment"
</pre>

<p>The response is an LDP container for the attachments. It can be any LDP
    container such as an <code>ldp:BasicContainer</code> or an
    <code>ldp:DirectContainer.</code> This example uses an
    <code>ldp:BasicContainer</code>. The attachment container only contains
    attachments for a single resource.</p>

<pre class="example">
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Allow: GET,HEAD,OPTIONS,POST
Content-Length: 323
Content-Type: text/turtle
ETag: W/"2773fef2237e91273bde782a43925458"
Link: &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Resource&gt;; rel="type",
      &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Container&gt;; rel="type",
Preference-Applied: return=representation
Vary: Accept,Prefer

@prefix oslc: &lt;http://open-services.net/ns/core#&gt; .
@prefix ldp:   &lt;http://w3.org/ns/ldp#&gt; .

&lt;http://example.com/bugs/2314/attachments&gt;
        a             oslc:AttachmentContainer , ldp:BasicContainer ;
        ldp:contains  &lt;http://example.com/bugs/2314/attachments/2&gt; , &lt;http://example.com/bugs/2314/attachments/1&gt; .
</pre>

<p>Clients can look at the <code>ldp:contains</code> property on the container
    for the attachments.</p>
</section>

<section id="ex_get_attachment">
<h2>Get the Attachment Content</h2>

<p>Once clients have the attachment URI, they can get the attachment by simply
    making an HTTP GET request to the attachment URI.</p>

<p>A <code>Slug</code> header can be included by a server in the
    response to a <code>GET</code> on an attachment resource. If a client wishes to store
    the content as a file, this value provides a hint as to the file name to
    use (subject, of course, to any file system restrictions). In the absence
    of an <code>Slug</code> header, the client may use the last segment of
    the resource's URI as a hint, or just choose an arbitrary file name.</p>


<pre class="example">
GET /bugs/2314/attachments/1 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
</pre>

<p>The response body is the attachment content. Servers should set the response
    <code>Content-Type</code> to describe the media type of the attachment. The
    response may have a <code>Content-Disposition</code> header with a filename
    parameter, although this isn't required. This example also contains a Link
    with relation <code>describedby</code>, which links to the
    <code>oslc:AttachmentDescriptor</code> for the attachment.</p>

<pre class="example">
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Allow: GET,HEAD,OPTIONS,PUT,DELETE
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="screenshot.png"
Content-Length: 53622
Content-Type: image/png
ETag: W/"678609cdee68e0fb8aea5f252b84a511"

      &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Resource&gt;; rel="type",
      &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#NonRDFSource&gt;; rel="type"

[binary content]
</pre>
</section>

<section id="ex_create_attachment">
<h2>Create an Attachment</h2>

<p>To create an attachment, POST the attachment content to the attachment
    container for the resource. The request should have a
    <code>Content-Type</code> header describing the attachment's media type and subtype as specified in <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/">Media Types</a>.
    The optional <code>Slug</code> header is used to give the attachment a
    name. The <code>Content-Length</code> header is used to initialize the attachment size.</p>

<p>A client can set a <code>Slug</code> header in the
    attachment-creating POST to specify a hint for a name for the resource as
    part of that single request. This can be important as some systems
    require a name at the time the attachment is created. Different systems may
    have different requirements for valid attachment names, so the value of the
    <code>Slug</code> header should be interpreted as a hint in this context.
    If the given name can not be used as specified, it is transformed into a
    valid name. If that is not possible or the header is not specified, an
    arbitrary value is assigned. Failure due to an invalid name is undesirable
    because of the potentially large size of an attachment resource.</p>

<p>The client can provide the attachment size in the <code>Content-Length</code> header and this can be used to initialize the <code>oslc:AttachmentDescriptor</code> <code>oslc:attachmentSize</code> property. The server may compute a different attachment size than that provided by the client if the client specified value is incorrect or not provided.</p>

<pre class="example">
POST /bugs/2314/attachments HTTP/1.1
Slug: design
Content-Type: application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.text
Content-Length: 18124

[binary content]
</pre>

<p>The response contains a Link to the new attachment in the
    <code>Location</code> header. This server has also included a Link to the
    <code>oslc:AttachmentDescriptor</code> for the attachment in the HTTP
    response, which contains metadata about the attachment.</p>

<p>When a server successfully creates an attachment resource, it
    responds with an HTTP status code of 201 (created)
    with the URI of the newly created attachment resource in the HTTP response
    <code>Location</code> header.  Additionally, if the server created an
    associated <code>oslc:AttachmentDescriptor</code> resource, the URI for
    this resource should be listed in the HTTP response <code>Link</code>
    header [[!RFC5988]] with <code>rel="describedby"</code> [[!LDP]].</p>

    <p>Properties for the AttachmentDescriptor that are not readOnly, such as its title and description, can be updated using the usual HTTP <code>PUT</code> method.</p>

<pre class="example">
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Allow: GET,HEAD,OPTIONS,POST
Location: http://example.com/bugs/2314/attachments/3
Link: &lt;http://example.com/bugs/2314/attachments/meta/3&gt;; rel="describedby"; anchor="http://example.com/bugs/2314/attachments/3",

</pre>
</section>

<section id="ex_update_attachment">
<h2>Update an Attachment</h2>

<p>To update an attachment, PUT the attachment content to the attachment
   resource.</p>

<pre class="example">
PUT /bugs/2314/attachments/3 HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.text
Content-Length: 19377

[binary content]
</pre>

<p>The server typically responds with a 204 No Content status if the request
    succeeds. It also updates an associated attachment metadata in the
    <code>oslc:AttachmentDescriptor</code> in the <code>describedby</code>
    link. For example, the client could have included a <code>Slug</code> header on the update request in order to rename the attachment.</p>

<pre class="example">
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
Link: &lt;http://example.com/bugs/2314/attachments/meta/3&gt;; rel="describedby"; anchor="http://example.com/bugs/2314/attachments/3",

Content-Length: 0
</pre>
</section>

<section id="ex_remove_attachment">
<h2>Remove an Attachment</h2>

<p>To remove an attachment, make a DELETE request on the attachment URI.  This
    removes the attachment from the container and deletes the content and attachment metadata from the
    server.</p>

<pre class="example">
DELETE /bugs/2314/attachments/3 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
</pre>

<p>The server typically responds with 204 No Content status if the request was
    successful.</p>

<pre class="example">

<section id="ex_inline_attachment_container">
<h2>Include Attachment Information Inline with a Resource</h2>

<p>Servers can choose to include the attachment information directly in the
    HTTP response for a resource although this isn't required. Here is an
    example defect resource that contains attachments. The attachment container
    is an <code>ldp:DirectContainer</code> where the membership resource is the
    defect itself. The membership predicate is <code>oslc:attachment</code>,
    although this predicate is not required. The following example shows the results
    of an <code>HTTP GET</code> on <code>http://example.com/bugs/2314</code>.</p>

<h2>Resource Constraints</h2>

<section id="descriptor_shape">
<h2>Resource: AttachmentDescriptor</h2>

<p>This document applies the following constraints to the [[!OSLCCoreVocab]] vocabulary terms.</p>

<p>The <code>oslc:AttachmentDescriptor</code> resource type is used to describe
    the binary resource (or non-RDF Resource) associated with a particular
    resource. When a client POSTs an attachment content to a server, the server
    stores the attachment content and assigns a URI just like any other type of
    resource creation but it may also create an
    <code>oslc:AttachmentDescriptor</code> resource to contain data about the
    attachment.</p>

<p>There is no restriction on the content of each attachment resource. For
    example, it could be a photo of a kitten, an installation manual, a log
    file, or a source code patch. Since the attachment cannot be expected to
    contain additional client or server supplied data, a typical set of
    properties for each attachment is included with the
    <code>oslc:AttachmentDescriptor</code> resource itself. Thus, the object of
    each <code>oslc:attachment</code> statement is the binary attachment.
    Issuing an HTTP HEAD or GET operation on that binary attachment resource
    URL should produce an HTTP response with a header value of <code>Link:
        rel='describedBy'</code> to indicate the URL of the
    <code>oslc:AttachmentDescriptor</code> resource.  The properties for the
    <code>oslc:AttachmentDescriptor</code> resource are indicated in the table
    below.</p>
