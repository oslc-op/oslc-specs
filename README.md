Configuration Management, and all the various OSLC domain specifications.

## Getting started

In order to preview the specifications in your local workspace, you should run a
local webserver (it is inadvisable to disable the security protections against
running AJAX requests on local filesystem). With Python 3 installed:

    cd docs/
    python3 -m http.server 8000 --bind 127.0.0.1

Now you can browse all specs via http://localhost:8000/. For an even better
experience, install Browsersync (`npm i -g browser-sync`) and run it the
following way:

    browser-sync start --config bs-config.js

Now you can browse all specs via http://localhost:8000/. **Anytime you save a spec
file, every browser tab where this file is opened will be reloaded
automatically.**

## Contributions

Read [how to contribute to the OSLC Open
Project](https://github.com/oslc-op/oslc-admin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

For this repository particularly, please ensure that your editor respects the
[Editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org/#download) settings either by installing
a plugin or copying the settings manually. Make sure your lines are wrapped!

> Pro tip: Atom editor does all of this automatically when you install an
Editorconfig for it. Highly recommended. It works even better in a setup with
Browsersync described in the section above.

> **Warning!** Eclipse, VS Code do not support the wrapping configuration
setting from Editorconfig. You should manually configure your editor and ensure
the lines are wrapped.

## Licensing
